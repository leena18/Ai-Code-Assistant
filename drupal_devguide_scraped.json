Join today Curated Guides Evaluator Guide Local Development Guide User Guide Appendix Local Development Guide Goals The purpose of this guide is to assist you with creating and installing a new Drupal application on your local machine for the purpose of development. Installing Drupal using the following instructions will give you a starting point for a website that can be deployed to a production environment. The intended audience for this guide is a developer. Evaluating Drupal? Create a disposable Drupal demo application to evaluate Drupal’s capabilities and codebase. Prerequisites You should be comfortable using a command-line terminal. See Moving Around the Command Line video tutorial . Sufficient system privileges to download and install new software. DDEV is a Docker -based tool that provides a preconfigured local development environment for Drupal. Install Docker for your OS before attempting to install DDEV. Local development with DDEV This guide provides instructions for installing Drupal’s system requirements by using a free, cross-platform local development solution, DDEV . Many viable local development environment solutions exist. Note: DDEV requires Docker. To install DDEV, see DDEV installation documentation . Configure your local development environment to serve your application Replace my-site with a machine-friendly (no spaces or special punctuation) name for your new application and run the following command (assumes DDEV): mkdir my-site\ncd my-site\nddev config --project-type drupal --docroot web This will create a new DDEV project configured to host a Drupal application. DDEV will store the generated configuration in a new .ddev subdirectory. Project name will be the same as the parent folder ( my-site ), define it with --project-name solrcloud . Next, start the DDEV container ddev start You now have a web server and database server configured and running. Configuring DDEV first allows us to run Composer from within DDEV instead of installing it locally. Create a new Drupal application Next, use Composer to install Drupal, which enables you to install and update dependencies (modules, themes, profiles, libraries, etc.) also with Composer. It is best practice to ensure that your entire Drupal application is managed with Composer in order to facilitate manageable upgrades. Now create a new Drupal application with Composer. Note: ddev composer create will unpack and download the files into the current folder, unlike composer create-project which downloads Drupal into a separate folder. ddev composer create drupal/recommended-project -y It is possible to install Drupal with Composer without using the DDEV environment, but not recommended, since PHP versions in DDEV and your local environment may differ. composer create-project drupal/recommended-project You now have a web server and database server configured and running. Install Drupal Next, you must install Drupal using Drush, which populates your Drupal application’s new database. First, install the latest version of Drush, a command-line utility for Drupal. ddev composer require drush/drush Using DDEV and Drush, execute the command below. ddev drush site:install -y Drupal is now installed, with an automatically generated password for the user #1 account (Administrator) . User name and password for user #1 can be specified with --account-name=myusername --account-pass=my-password . Log In Finally, launch your new Drupal site and log in. ddev launch You can also generate a one-time login link for the administrator account (user id #1). ddev drush user:login If necessary, execute ddev describe to view the URL of your site. Copy and paste that URL into your web browser to visit it. Next steps What now? Learn how you can begin to extend and customize your new Drupal application. Visit the Drupal User Guide and read the following chapters: Chapter 4. Basic Site Configuration Chapter 5. Basic Page Management Chapter 6. Setting Up Content Structure Appendix We chose to use DDEV for this local development guide because it met the following criteria: Must be free and open source, without tying users into a proprietary product or service. Must be well maintained, with long term support. Must follow Drupal best practices. Must be compatible with MacOS, Windows, and Linux. Must be as simple as possible Fewest pre-requisites Fewest manual steps To suggest a different local development solution, please create an issue in the Official Docs issue queue .

Join today Curated Guides Evaluator Guide Local Development Guide User Guide Appendix Local Development Guide Goals The purpose of this guide is to assist you with creating and installing a new Drupal application on your local machine for the purpose of development. Installing Drupal using the following instructions will give you a starting point for a website that can be deployed to a production environment. The intended audience for this guide is a developer. Evaluating Drupal? Create a disposable Drupal demo application to evaluate Drupal’s capabilities and codebase. Prerequisites You should be comfortable using a command-line terminal. See Moving Around the Command Line video tutorial . Sufficient system privileges to download and install new software. DDEV is a Docker -based tool that provides a preconfigured local development environment for Drupal. Install Docker for your OS before attempting to install DDEV. Local development with DDEV This guide provides instructions for installing Drupal’s system requirements by using a free, cross-platform local development solution, DDEV . Many viable local development environment solutions exist. Note: DDEV requires Docker. To install DDEV, see DDEV installation documentation . Configure your local development environment to serve your application Replace my-site with a machine-friendly (no spaces or special punctuation) name for your new application and run the following command (assumes DDEV): mkdir my-site\ncd my-site\nddev config --project-type drupal --docroot web This will create a new DDEV project configured to host a Drupal application. DDEV will store the generated configuration in a new .ddev subdirectory. Project name will be the same as the parent folder ( my-site ), define it with --project-name solrcloud . Next, start the DDEV container ddev start You now have a web server and database server configured and running. Configuring DDEV first allows us to run Composer from within DDEV instead of installing it locally. Create a new Drupal application Next, use Composer to install Drupal, which enables you to install and update dependencies (modules, themes, profiles, libraries, etc.) also with Composer. It is best practice to ensure that your entire Drupal application is managed with Composer in order to facilitate manageable upgrades. Now create a new Drupal application with Composer. Note: ddev composer create will unpack and download the files into the current folder, unlike composer create-project which downloads Drupal into a separate folder. ddev composer create drupal/recommended-project -y It is possible to install Drupal with Composer without using the DDEV environment, but not recommended, since PHP versions in DDEV and your local environment may differ. composer create-project drupal/recommended-project You now have a web server and database server configured and running. Install Drupal Next, you must install Drupal using Drush, which populates your Drupal application’s new database. First, install the latest version of Drush, a command-line utility for Drupal. ddev composer require drush/drush Using DDEV and Drush, execute the command below. ddev drush site:install -y Drupal is now installed, with an automatically generated password for the user #1 account (Administrator) . User name and password for user #1 can be specified with --account-name=myusername --account-pass=my-password . Log In Finally, launch your new Drupal site and log in. ddev launch You can also generate a one-time login link for the administrator account (user id #1). ddev drush user:login If necessary, execute ddev describe to view the URL of your site. Copy and paste that URL into your web browser to visit it. Next steps What now? Learn how you can begin to extend and customize your new Drupal application. Visit the Drupal User Guide and read the following chapters: Chapter 4. Basic Site Configuration Chapter 5. Basic Page Management Chapter 6. Setting Up Content Structure Appendix We chose to use DDEV for this local development guide because it met the following criteria: Must be free and open source, without tying users into a proprietary product or service. Must be well maintained, with long term support. Must follow Drupal best practices. Must be compatible with MacOS, Windows, and Linux. Must be as simple as possible Fewest pre-requisites Fewest manual steps To suggest a different local development solution, please create an issue in the Official Docs issue queue .

Before you create an account on this Website, however, we ask that you please read and agree to the following Terms of Service (“Terms of Service”). Overview These Terms of Service are meant to tell you about the services the Association provides through Drupal.org, and the rights and responsibilities that guide us both. Although the Association makes Drupal.org available to the community, it is the community, including you, that creates the majority of contributions to the site. Our intent is to provide a platform for the community to do its work. The Drupal community is actively engaged in the governance and improvement of Drupal.org. This includes code contributions as well as oversight provided by members of the Drupal.org Content, Software, and Infrastructure Working Groups. As the organization with legal responsibility for Drupal.org, the Association asks that you follow the policies outlined in this Terms of Service. The following terms and conditions (including any documents referred to in them) (collectively, the \"Terms of Service\"), apply to your use of the Drupal.org website and all *.drupal.org subsites (collectively, the \"Website\"), as well as any content, functionality and services offered to you, whether as a guest or a registered user, on or through the Website.

Join today Curated Guides Evaluator Guide Local Development Guide User Guide Appendix Local Development Guide Goals The purpose of this guide is to assist you with creating and installing a new Drupal application on your local machine for the purpose of development. Installing Drupal using the following instructions will give you a starting point for a website that can be deployed to a production environment. The intended audience for this guide is a developer. Evaluating Drupal? Create a disposable Drupal demo application to evaluate Drupal’s capabilities and codebase. Prerequisites You should be comfortable using a command-line terminal. See Moving Around the Command Line video tutorial . Sufficient system privileges to download and install new software. DDEV is a Docker -based tool that provides a preconfigured local development environment for Drupal. Install Docker for your OS before attempting to install DDEV. Local development with DDEV This guide provides instructions for installing Drupal’s system requirements by using a free, cross-platform local development solution, DDEV . Many viable local development environment solutions exist. Note: DDEV requires Docker. To install DDEV, see DDEV installation documentation . Configure your local development environment to serve your application Replace my-site with a machine-friendly (no spaces or special punctuation) name for your new application and run the following command (assumes DDEV): mkdir my-site\ncd my-site\nddev config --project-type drupal --docroot web This will create a new DDEV project configured to host a Drupal application. DDEV will store the generated configuration in a new .ddev subdirectory. Project name will be the same as the parent folder ( my-site ), define it with --project-name solrcloud . Next, start the DDEV container ddev start You now have a web server and database server configured and running. Configuring DDEV first allows us to run Composer from within DDEV instead of installing it locally. Create a new Drupal application Next, use Composer to install Drupal, which enables you to install and update dependencies (modules, themes, profiles, libraries, etc.) also with Composer. It is best practice to ensure that your entire Drupal application is managed with Composer in order to facilitate manageable upgrades. Now create a new Drupal application with Composer. Note: ddev composer create will unpack and download the files into the current folder, unlike composer create-project which downloads Drupal into a separate folder. ddev composer create drupal/recommended-project -y It is possible to install Drupal with Composer without using the DDEV environment, but not recommended, since PHP versions in DDEV and your local environment may differ. composer create-project drupal/recommended-project You now have a web server and database server configured and running. Install Drupal Next, you must install Drupal using Drush, which populates your Drupal application’s new database. First, install the latest version of Drush, a command-line utility for Drupal. ddev composer require drush/drush Using DDEV and Drush, execute the command below. ddev drush site:install -y Drupal is now installed, with an automatically generated password for the user #1 account (Administrator) . User name and password for user #1 can be specified with --account-name=myusername --account-pass=my-password . Log In Finally, launch your new Drupal site and log in. ddev launch You can also generate a one-time login link for the administrator account (user id #1). ddev drush user:login If necessary, execute ddev describe to view the URL of your site. Copy and paste that URL into your web browser to visit it. Next steps What now? Learn how you can begin to extend and customize your new Drupal application. Visit the Drupal User Guide and read the following chapters: Chapter 4. Basic Site Configuration Chapter 5. Basic Page Management Chapter 6. Setting Up Content Structure Appendix We chose to use DDEV for this local development guide because it met the following criteria: Must be free and open source, without tying users into a proprietary product or service. Must be well maintained, with long term support. Must follow Drupal best practices. Must be compatible with MacOS, Windows, and Linux. Must be as simple as possible Fewest pre-requisites Fewest manual steps To suggest a different local development solution, please create an issue in the Official Docs issue queue .

Drupal grows as you grow with thousands of free modules and themes that will help you attract the web audience you need to deliver your message, grow brand awareness, and build your community. Drupal is accessible and multilingual. The latest release of Drupal is the most powerful and accessible version of Drupal to date. With the accessibility and multilingual capabilities built into Drupal, you can be confident that you will have the ability to reach the audience you're aiming for to convey your message. Drupal is flexible by design. There is a range of desktop tools that allow you to build a web application on your own computer, and choose a Drupal hosting service provider that meets your needs. You can be sure that any Drupal website and/or application will run on many platforms, and can be moved easily. Take Drupal for a test drive at SimplyTest.me We love Drupal and we hope you will, too. You can test-drive a newly installed Drupal site on your own in less than a few minutes at SimplyTest.me (Link opens in a new tab/window.) After a few clicks, you'll have access to a full Drupal installation to evaluate. To learn more about customizing your Drupal evaluation installation on SimplyTest.me , consult their question & answer page . Note: The evaluation site will expire after 12 hours. The software you need to get is free Installing and running Drupal is completely free. This includes the 40,000+ modules available to extend site functionality and the 2500+ themes used for modifying the site appearance. If you are running the site locally, you may also need to install a \"stack\" - the behind-the-scenes software that serves your website. The underlying 'stack' A Drupal site needs a small 'stack' of software that works in the background to serve your site and store your content: Server software Database software PHP interpreting software (Drupal is written in the PHP programming language.) This stack is already installed on most, if not all commercial web hosts. For local development, this stack is available in many forms, but a Docker-based development environments such as DDEV or Lando is recommended. The two code sets used by every Drupal site: Codebase and database Codebase: These are the files and folders you get when you download Drupal. These files in the codebase are responsible for creating and managing all of your site's content, such as articles, or user comments, The content itself (as well as settings and config) is stored in the database. When you want to duplicate or move a Drupal site, you need to grab a copy of both the code base and database. Flexibility, meet simplicity Solutions for the content management struggle to balance flexibility and simplicity. If a solution is simple, it can only be used for a single purpose and if it is flexible, it may be too difficult for newcomers to learn. The average content management system (CMS) is like a toy truck. Specific assumptions have been made about how it will be used and these assumptions are difficult to override. Content management frameworks, on the other hand, are like the raw materials needed to make any toy—no assumptions have been made about how they'll be used and the builder needs expert technical knowledge in order to make anything at all. Drupal is designed to be the perfect content management solution provider for non-technical users who need both simplicity and flexibility. It accomplishes this through its modular approach to site-building. Unlike other CMSs, Drupal isn’t a prefabricated toy truck, but rather a collection of wheels, windshields, axles, frames, etc., that a toy maker can easily connect together. With Drupal, a maker could create a toy truck and similarly can also create a toy such as an airplane, submarine, or robot. For this reason, Drupal may be described as both a content management system and a content management framework—one unified system that strives to have the strengths of both, without their deficiencies. So, whether a site builder is looking to create a news site, online store, social network, blog, wiki, or anything else, it’s just a matter of combining the right modules. The only limitation is the creator’s imagination. Drupal in action To clarify the difference between Drupal and other CMSs, consider the example of a news site. You want to be able to post news articles on the site and you want the homepage to have a section featuring the five most recent ones. Next, you decide that you want to add a blog section and put a list of links to the five most recent blog entries on the homepage as well. If you were using an ordinary CMS, first you would install a plugin that handled news articles and could put short blurbs on the homepage. Next, you’d install a plugin that would track the latest blog posts and put a list of those on the home page. Each plugin would only be responsible for tracking and managing a particular kind of content and each would remain relatively isolated from the others. But, what happens when you have that brilliant, middle-of-the-night idea to blend these two functions by showing a list of blog posts about the latest news items, ordered according to contributor activity? You may be out of luck if you’re using a “toy truck” CMS. Or, you may need to hire a developer to write a custom plugin from scratch. But through the power of Drupal way, the way of manageable abstraction, you can accomplish this task quickly and easily. Since Drupal's modules do things in a standard way and interface with a common underlying system, building all sorts of clever, customized features is just a matter of snapping parts together. In this example, you could just use Views . Of course, this flexibility comes at a certain cost. While a toy truck is instantly understandable and ready to use without much thought, a modular vehicle construction kit will, by nature, require you to read the instruction manual first. The building blocks are available, but you'll need to learn how they fit together before you can take a paper prototype and turn it into a full-featured website. Drupal core and the thousands of contributed modules that build on it, require an initial investment to learn, but mastering the Drupal way is immensely rewarding; the passionate community is a testament to Drupal's power to liberate site builders from the simplicity/flexibility dilemma. Once you've tried Drupal, you'll likely leave your toy truck and boat in the closet to gather dust. How Drupal does it Intrigued yet? Let's take a closer look at how Drupal works. People often think of a website as a collection of static pages, perhaps with some functions like a blog or a news engine thrown in to round it out. When they go to manage their site, they are thinking in terms of a treelike hierarchy of pages that they will edit. Drupal, however, treats most content types as variations on the same concept: a node (more on this in a moment). Static pages, blog posts, and news items (some possible node types) are all stored in the same way and the site's navigation structure is designed separately for editing menus, views (lists of content), and blocks (side content which often has links to different site sections). It’s a lot like the separation you find in standards-compliant page coding—HTML5 provides the meaningful structure of the information, while CSS arranges it for presentation. In Drupal, nodes hold the structured information pertaining to a blog post (such as title, content, author, date) or a news item (title, content, go-live date, takedown date), while the menu system, as well as taxonomy (tagging of content) and views, create an information architecture. Finally, the theme system, along with display modules like Layout Builder, controls how all this looks to site visitors. Since these layers are kept separate, you can provide completely different navigation and presentation of your content to different users based on their specific needs and roles. Pages can be grouped differently and prioritized in a different order and various functions and content can be shown or hidden as needed. Nodes: The secret to Drupal's flexibility We don't talk about \"nodes\" every day, but since they are at the heart of Drupal's design, they deserve further investigation. Essentially, a node is a set of related bits of information. When you create a new blog post, you are not only defining its body text, but also its title, content, author link, creation date, taxonomy (tags), etc. Some of these elements will be shown by the theme layer when the node is displayed. Others are meta-data that control when the node will show up at all - such as taxonomy or publishing status. As suggested before, you aren't limited to a single way of presenting your site's content. You can define many navigation schemes, custom themes, or designs for the site. You can look at some contributed themes here . Comments also illustrate the Drupal way. Comments are typically thought of as part of a blogging system, but there isn't a separate \"blogging system\" in Drupal. Drupal simply manipulates nodes to function in a manner that most people think of as a blog. But comments can be enabled on any content type (or node) you choose - be it blog posts, news items, book pages (which provide basic wiki features), or any other type you may create. Drupal's modular system is limited only to the imagination of the site builder. Collaborative at the core Creating an informational website that broadcasts from “one to many” is something that most CMSs do right out of the box. Drupal shines, however, by empowering site users to create content and to interact with each other - moving from \"one to many\" to \"many to many.\" With some CMSs, you can set up a blog and you can install plugins to handle having a community of users. But what happens when you want to give individual blogs to each of your users, sorting their contents so that they can be displayed individually with their own skins, while also generating cross-blog topical digests, top-five lists, and links to elaborate, customized user profiles? What if you also want to integrate those blogs with forums, a wiki-like environment, and user-owned galleries of tagged photos? A typical CMS's approach to information makes such a scenario very difficult to implement. In contrast, the Drupal way makes such a scenario not only easy to establish but also incredibly manageable over time. Drupal is designed from the ground up so site builders can delegate content creation and even site administration, to users. All a site builder has to do is define user permissions for which users get to do what and then everyone can start collaborating. Get started quickly, customize extensively Drupal's flexibility is incredible, but installing it is surprisingly easy. With a simple FTP upload and a few short web-based configuration questions, you can connect to your database and have your first Drupal site up and running within an hour. Pick one of the included themes and just start adding content. Do you want to have visitors log in? Then you should switch \"authentication\" on or off. Want to switch on some of the included tools? Then you should enable commenting on node types; turn on the book module for wiki-like collaboration; create forms and polls; use taxonomy to give site content structured, hierarchical categorization, or free-form tagging. Do you want your own skin applied to the site? Drupal's theme system uses the Twig templating system allows you to insert dynamic content without needing any raw PHP. Drupal’s generated markup is clean, standards-compliant HTML5. No old-school tables. No cruft. No kidding. The Drupal flow If you want to go deeper with Drupal, you should understand how information flows between the system's layers. There are five main layers to consider: At the base of the system is the collection of nodes, the data pool. Before anything can be displayed on the site, it must be input as data. The next layer up is where modules live. Modules are functional plugins that are either part of the Drupal core (they ship with Drupal) or are contributed items that have been created by members of the Drupal community. Modules build on Drupal's core functionality, allowing you to customize the data items (fields) on your node types; set up e-commerce; programmatically sort and display content (custom output controlled by filters you define); and more. There are thousands of different options within the fast-growing repository of contributed Drupal modules . They represent the innovation and collaborative effort of everyone from individuals to large corporations. At the next layer, we find blocks and menus. Blocks often provide the output from a module or can be created to display whatever you want and then can be placed in various spots (Regions) in your template (theme) layout. Blocks can be configured to output in various ways, as well as only showing on certain defined pages, or only for certain defined users. Menus are navigators in Drupal, which define the content coming in each defined menu path (relative URL). Menus are a core element of Drupal that provide links to all the pages created in Drupal. Next are user permissions. This is where settings are configured to determine what different kinds of users are allowed to do and see. Permissions are defined for various roles and in turn, users are assigned to these roles in order to grant them the defined permissions. On the top layer is the site theme (the \"skin\"). This is made up predominantly of HTML5 and CSS, with some Twig variables intermixed, so Drupal-generated content can go in the appropriate spots. Also included with each theme is a set of functions that can be used to override standard functions in the modules in order to provide complete control over how the modules generate their markup at output time. Templates can also be assigned on-the-fly based on user permissions. This directional flow from bottom to top controls how Drupal works. Is some new functionality you want not showing up? Perhaps you uploaded the module into the system but have not activated it yet and this is making everything downstream non-functional (as in \"A\" in the diagram above). Maybe the module is installed and activated, but you still don’t see what you want on your site. Did you forget to place the block, as in \"B\"? Or are your user permission settings conflicting with what you want, and your users are not set to see the output as in \"C\"? Additionally, as mentioned earlier, getting the kind of granular control you want over the details of the HTML5 module outputs requires understanding this flow. Are you using a module that does exactly what you want, only you wish the markup was just a little bit different? Maybe you’d like it to use different tags, or you’d like to assign a CSS class to something? You accomplish this by copying the output function from the module and pushing it up to the functions document in your theme. Modify the code there and when the system goes to output, it will see your customized function and use that instead. Get up close and personal Now that you’ve gotten a brief introduction to the Drupal way, why not install Drupal on your server or test-drive Drupal online (simplytest.me) and try it for yourself?. The Installation & Configuration guide gives step-by-step instructions if you need help getting started. Welcome to the community of Drupal users and happy site building!

Continuous innovation Powerful new features delivered continuously keep Drupal at the cutting edge. Seamless upgrades Drupal’s commitment to easy upgrades means never having to worry about staying up to date. Get Started Upgrade now Drupal 11 makes structured content, workflows, and content governance more flexible and easier for ambitious builders Easily apply complex configuration with recipes Recipes is a new experimental feature. Add new capabilities to Drupal instantly with recipes by applying a set of predefined configuration (for example, content types, user roles, and so on) to your site. Create your own recipes to share or reuse, or apply recipes created by others. Robust content staging workflow on your production site Workspaces provide a powerful set of tools for managing content changes. Stage new content or preview a full site overhaul by using multiple workspaces on a single site. You can continue to make edits directly on the live site, and publish the staged changes when ready. Simplified front-end development with Single-Directory Components Drupal now natively supports the Single-Directory Components approach to theming. It provides a simplified front-end development workflow based on components. All necessary code for each component lives in a single directory, making it self-contained and reusable. Webinar: Unpacking Drupal 11 Watch Now On-Demand Watch Dries Buytaert and Tim Lehnen, CTO, Drupal Association, discuss new features, step-by-step guidance on updating from Drupal 10 to Drupal 11 and the key benefits of Drupal 11 now and down the road. Watch Now Sponsored content The future of Drupal 11 and Drupal CMS There are more features to look forward to in future releases of Drupal 11 itself. New features are added on a six-month release cycle as part of minor releases. We are also working on the Drupal Starshot Initiative to build a new enhanced default download of Drupal 11, called Drupal CMS. That will include preconfigured best practice solutions from the contributed project ecosystem. Key building blocks of Drupal CMS and future Drupal 11 versions are: Automatic Updates will allow you to update Drupal core directly through the Drupal administrative interface. It applies patch-level updates to Drupal core in a separate, sandboxed copy of your site to keep you up and running until the update is completely ready to be deployed. It can detect and report problems at every stage of the update process, so you don't have to find out about them after an update is live.  It automatically detects upcoming database updates and helps you run them during the process. Project Browser will make it easy for site builders to extend the functionality, look, and feel of Drupal. It provides a search interface in the Drupal administrative interface for finding contributed modules and themes and researching their capabilities. Once you select an extension, instructions are provided on how to install it on your site. All of this is available without leaving your website. Learn more about the Drupal Starshot Initiative Why you'll love Drupal Ease of use Empowering content editors and marketers with easy-to-use tools that can be customized to their needs. Commitment to accessibility Taking out-of-the-box accessibility to a new level as we prioritize accessibility with each newly added feature and interface. Content hub for web, mobile, and more Drupal's structured content model and flexible web service APIs serve all your channels from one source. Powerful editorial digital management tools With reusable media and publication workflows, your marketing team has the latest tools at their fingertips. API-first architecture At the forefront of headless and decoupled architecture, Drupal enables you to integrate with next-generation channels and devices. Performance and scalability Advanced caching solutions make Drupal the perfect fit for some of the largest sites on the web. Multilingual Drupal has the best language support of any content management system and is available in dozens languages. Security through transparency Designed to leverage the power of open source, with thousands of developers keeping an eye on the code and an industry-leading security team. Standing on the shoulders of giants Drupal builds on the best supporting technologies from the open source ecosystem: Composer, Symfony, Twig, PHPUnit, PHPStan and more. Drupal releases incorporate updates to these systems, keeping your site up to date, stable, and secure, and take advantage of new capabilities. Extensible with thousands of free add-ons Add functionality to your site easily with thousands of contributed modules that are available for free. If you want it, chances are, someone else has built it. Or, as we like to say, 'There's a module for that.' That includes modules to integrate Drupal with external services and other applications in your infrastructure. Many popular services are already covered. If you can't find the right module, or you need to integrate with an internal application, you can create a custom module. No other content management software is this powerful and scalable. Extend Drupal 11 with modules 1858 people from 590 organizations contributed to Drupal 11 The Drupal project is open source software. Anyone can download, use, work on, and share it with others. More than a thousand organizations collaborate in the Drupal ecosystem. The elegant solutions you build, the incredible experiences you design, and the powerful integrations you create are all things you can give back to make Drupal even better.

Do you have Drupal knowledge to share? We invite you to submit your session! Contributing your voice and expertise drives Drupal’s continued evolution and success. Submit your session Headless, Decoupled or ‘CaaS’ Whichever you call it, Drupal offers this simplified functionality. How do brands and organizations manage content—ranging from blog posts to whitepapers to case studies, videos, emails, webinars, sales assets and more—that serves multiple functions for disparate audiences in a multi-device, multi-channel world? Store it all in the cloud. Access it via Drupal. With its multisite and Content-as-a-Service (CaaS) functionality—also known as headless or decoupled—Drupal offers a preconfigured development environment, which supports full-scale digital content lifecycle management. Customers tend to drift from one content silo to another, and by creating content components that are independently set aside from the building of a website, the front end application is not tied to the content management system, a.k.a. CaaS. Drupal allows for: Creating reusable content Displaying content in various layouts Achieving optimal responsiveness Scaling regardless of size Customizing views for content authors, editors Content for a range of websites/services can be managed from one location, and deployed to many. Drupal’s open architecture and APIs provide developers both a tool and framework for creating feature-rich deliverables. Equal Opportunity Community Initiative OPTASY redefines EOCI's Drupal site for better engagement, mobile optimization, and increased conversions. Tampa International Airport Tampa International Airport (TPA) came to Aten with a desire to make their Drupal website as easy to navigate as the airport itself.

Major League Soccer (MLS) Major League Soccer needed highly sophisticated customization options based on each team’s design, content priorities, and site maintainers’ capabilities. Pinterest for Business Working closely with Pinterest, Phase2 architected a Drupal system to elevate their global brand and drive growth via a new suite of marketing, business, and community sites. Content-as-a-Service: What You Need to Know Content-as-a-service (CaaS) allows brands to create once and publish everywhere.

Submit your session The leader in every language With more than 100 languages immediately available in Drupal, no CMS offers better multilingual capabilities. Contact a Drupal Service Provider Drupal’s automated language translation​ allows you to reach different audiences with localized content. Your messages and information can target specific geographic locales or audiences—and languages instantly and seamlessly appear. Ensure that content and documentation are authored, updated and delivered continually in any market around the world. Core modules in Drupal allow full translation of every part of a site; content types and their particular fields, menus, blocks, taxonomy, users, contact forms, comments... Drupal also allows for detection of (assumed) preferred language — according to user’s IP address, browser settings, URL, session and more. This can be set up in the language detection and selection tab. In addition, Drupal supports languages with right-to-left text direction. Those available by default include Arabic, Hebrew and Farsi.

Contact a Drupal Service Provider ‘Drupal’ is synonymous with advanced security As an open source project, Drupal has the advantage of scrutiny, maintenance and ongoing input from developers worldwide, as well as a dedicated staff team of security experts collaborating consistently to address and release security fixes. With more than 1,000,000 developers worldwide contributing — including a large professional service provider ecosystem — the result is one of the most secure and stable platforms on the market. Drupal is resilient against critical internet vulnerabilities — as evidenced by the proven 15+ year record of the dedicated Security Team identifying and mitigating potential vulnerabilities. Many security problems are prevented entirely by Drupal’s strong coding standards and strict community code review process. As a result, mission-critical sites and applications choose Drupal, testing its security against the most stringent standards. Banking, governments, public administration and healthcare are the fastest-growing industries adopting Drupal, primarily for the rigorous security. Recently the European Commission bug bounty program began funding Drupal as an investment in its entities.

Get your tickets now Security advisories Show advisories for only Drupal Core , only contributed projects , or only PSAs Persistent Login - Moderately critical - Access bypass - SA-CONTRIB-2024-044 Date: 2024-October-02 Security risk: Moderately critical 11 ∕ 25 AC:Basic/A:User/CI:Some/II:None/E:Theoretical/TD:All This module enables users to remain logged in separately from session timeouts. The module doesn't sufficiently check a user's disabled status when validating cookies. This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have an unexpired cookie from a previous successful login. Read more about Persistent Login - Moderately critical - Access bypass - SA-CONTRIB-2024-044 Two-factor Authentication (TFA) - Critical - Access bypass - SA-CONTRIB-2024-043 Date: 2024-October-02 Security risk: Critical 15 ∕ 25 AC:Complex/A:None/CI:Some/II:Some/E:Theoretical/TD:All This module enables you to allow and/or require users to use a second authentication method in addition to password authentication. The module does not sufficiently migrate sessions before prompting for a second factor token. Read more about Two-factor Authentication (TFA) - Critical - Access bypass - SA-CONTRIB-2024-043 Diff - Moderately critical - Access bypass, Information Disclosure - SA-CONTRIB-2024-042 Date: 2024-October-02 Security risk: Moderately critical 11 ∕ 25 AC:Basic/A:User/CI:Some/II:None/E:Theoretical/TD:All This module adds a tab for sufficiently permissioned users. The tab shows all revisions like standard Drupal but it also allows pretty viewing of all added/changed/deleted words between revisions. The module doesn't sufficiently check revision access before rendering a diff report for 1) nodes or 2) general entities that support diff. Read more about Diff - Moderately critical - Access bypass, Information Disclosure - SA-CONTRIB-2024-042 Smart IP Ban - Critical - Access bypass - SA-CONTRIB-2024-041 Date: 2024-September-18 Security risk: Critical 18 ∕ 25 AC:None/A:None/CI:Some/II:Some/E:Theoretical/TD:All The Smart IP Ban module enables a site to automatically ban an IP address based upon too many failed authentications. The module doesn't sufficiently protect access to certain paths provided by the module allowing a malicious user to view and modify the settings. Read more about Smart IP Ban - Critical - Access bypass - SA-CONTRIB-2024-041 File Entity (fieldable files) - Moderately critical - Information Disclosure - SA-CONTRIB-2024-040 Date: 2024-September-11 Security risk: Moderately critical 10 ∕ 25 AC:Basic/A:User/CI:Some/II:None/E:Theoretical/TD:Default This module enables you to store and manage both private and public files, provides the ability to add fieldable metadata for file_entity bundle types in addition to core file_managed data. The module doesn't sufficiently ensure that folders exist within the private destination prior to writing to them. If the subfolder doesn't exist, the module places the file in a publicly accessible directory. This vulnerability only affects sites with private files. Read more about File Entity (fieldable files) - Moderately critical - Information Disclosure - SA-CONTRIB-2024-040 Security Kit - Less critical - Denial of Service - SA-CONTRIB-2024-039 Date: 2024-September-11 Security risk: Less critical 9 ∕ 25 AC:Basic/A:None/CI:None/II:None/E:Theoretical/TD:Default This module provides Drupal with various security-hardening options, for example by emitting various configurable HTTP response headers. The module doesn't sufficiently validate input in Content Security Policy (CSP) violation reports. This can cause errors when a logging module (e.g. dblog or syslog) attempts to parse the resulting log message which contains invalid data. Read more about Security Kit - Less critical - Denial of Service - SA-CONTRIB-2024-039 Open Social - Moderately critical - Denial of Service - SA-CONTRIB-2024-038 Date: 2024-September-04 Security risk: Moderately critical 10 ∕ 25 AC:Basic/A:None/CI:None/II:None/E:Theoretical/TD:All Open Social is a Drupal distribution for online communities. The distribution didn't validate the flood control limits on the password reset form correctly resulting in a potential attacker flooding the password reset which could result in a Denial of Service. Fortunately the message does not disclose any information to the attacker. Read more about Open Social - Moderately critical - Denial of Service - SA-CONTRIB-2024-038 Open Social - Moderately critical - Cross Site Scripting, Denial of Service - SA-CONTRIB-2024-037 Date: 2024-September-04 Security risk: Moderately critical 13 ∕ 25 AC:Basic/A:User/CI:Some/II:Some/E:Theoretical/TD:Default Open Social is a Drupal distribution for online communities, which ships with an optional module called Social Embed. This module allows a website to display embedded content (such as photos or videos) when a user posts a link to that resource, without having to parse the resource directly. Added URL's were not sufficiently validated which could lead to a DoS via Blind SSRF and/or Application Takeover via Stored XSS. This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that social_embed submodule needs to be enabled. Read more about Open Social - Moderately critical - Cross Site Scripting, Denial of Service - SA-CONTRIB-2024-037 Paragraphs table - Critical - Access bypass, Information Disclosure - SA-CONTRIB-2024-036 Date: 2024-September-04 Security risk: Critical 15 ∕ 25 AC:None/A:User/CI:Some/II:Some/E:Theoretical/TD:Default This module enables field collections to be displayed as tables. It supports display suite and field permissions and provides operations (modify, delete, duplicate). This module has multiple vulnerabilities due to the requirements on the routes it provides not being restrictive enough. Information disclosure Several routes only checked for the 'access content' permission before displaying a paragraph, and did not check whether the user should actually have access to view the paragraph in question. Read more about Paragraphs table - Critical - Access bypass, Information Disclosure - SA-CONTRIB-2024-036 Content Entity Clone - Moderately critical - Information Disclosure - SA-CONTRIB-2024-035 Date: 2024-September-04 Security risk: Moderately critical 11 ∕ 25 AC:Basic/A:User/CI:Some/II:None/E:Theoretical/TD:All This module enables you to \"clone\" a content entity, i.e. to create a new content pre-filled with data from another entity of the same type and bundle. The module doesn't properly check the user access to the original entity, allowing users to create a new entity (they have permission to create) pre-filled with content from another entity of the same type and bundle that they would normally not have access to. This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker must have the permission to create content of the type of the entity to clone.

Under the Barcelona Sun: A Recap of Our Team’s Journey at DrupalCon Europe 2024 Posted by ImageX - 4 Oct 2024 at 05:15 UTC Authored by Nadiia Nykolaichuk .

Migrating Your Data from D7 to D10: Migrating field formatter settings Posted by Tag1 Consulting - 3 Oct 2024 at 05:19 UTC If you have been following our series, you have already migrated view modes—a prerequisite for field formatters. In this article, we are completing field-related migrations by importing formatter settings. This step builds on our previous work with view modes and field groups, bringing us closer to a functional Drupal 10 site. Read more mauricio Thu, 10/03/2024 - 04:01 Entity theming with Pinto Posted by PreviousNext - 3 Oct 2024 at 00:22 UTC Learn how to make entity theming a breeze using the Pinto module. If you haven’t already, check out the first part of this series for an introduction to all things Pinto . by adam.bramley / 3 October 2024 In our last post, we discussed Pinto concepts and how to use Theme objects to encapsulate theming logic in a central place for a component. Next, we’ll apply that knowledge to theming an entity. This will demonstrate the power of Pinto and how it will dramatically improve the velocity of delivering new components. One of the hardest things about theming Drupal is outputting markup that matches your design system. For example: Removing the “div soup” of Drupal fields Adding custom classes or attributes to field output Wrapping fields in custom tags (e.g. an h2) While there are plenty of modules to alleviate this, it can often mean you have a mix of YAML configuration for markup, preprocess hooks, overridden templates, etc., to pull everything together. Pinto allows you to easily render an entity while reusing your frontender’s perfect template! We need to cover a few more concepts and set things up to pull this all together. Once set up, new bundles or entity types can be added with ease. We'll continue our Card component example from the previous post and cover: Read more Solving the Maker-Taker problem Posted by Dries Buytaert - 2 Oct 2024 at 17:29 UTC Recently, a public dispute has emerged between WordPress co-founder Matt Mullenweg and hosting company WP Engine. Matt has accused WP Engine of misleading users through its branding and profiting from WordPress without adequately contributing back to the project. As the Founder and Project Lead of Drupal , another major open source Content Management System (CMS), I hesitated to weigh in on this debate, as this could be perceived as opportunistic. In the end, I decided to share my perspective because this conflict affects the broader open source community. I've known Matt Mullenweg since the early days, and we've grown both our open source projects and companies alongside each other. With our shared interests and backgrounds, I consider Matt a good friend and can relate uniquely to him. Equally valuable to me are my relationships with WP Engine's leadership, including CEO Heather Brunner and Founder Jason Cohen, both of whom I've met several times. I have deep admiration for what they’ve achieved with WP Engine. Although this post was prompted by the controversy between Automattic and WP Engine, it is not about them. I don't have insight into their respective contributions to WordPress, and I'm not here to judge. I've made an effort to keep this post as neutral as possible. Instead, this post is about two key challenges that many open source projects face: Read more State of Drupal presentation (September 2024) Posted by Drupal blog - 2 Oct 2024 at 16:30 UTC This blog has been re-posted and edited with permission from Dries Buytaert's blog . DrupalCon Barcelona 2024 Driesnote presentation Approximately 1,100 Drupal enthusiasts gathered in Barcelona, Spain, last week for DrupalCon Europe. As per tradition, I delivered my State of Drupal keynote, often referred to as the \"DriesNote\". If you missed it, you can watch the video or download my slides (177 MB). In my keynote, I gave an update on Drupal Starshot , an ambitious initiative we launched at DrupalCon Portland 2024 . Originally called Drupal Starshot, inspired by President Kennedy's Moonshot challenge , the product is now officially named Drupal CMS . The goal of Drupal CMS is to set the standard for no-code website building. It will allow non-technical users, like marketers, content creators, and site builders, to create digital experiences with ease, without compromising on the power and flexibility that Drupal is known for. A four-month progress report A preview of Drupal.org's front page with the updated Drupal brand and content. Read more Automatically generate forms from config schema Posted by ComputerMinds.co.uk - 2 Oct 2024 at 15:08 UTC Drupal's form API has been brilliant for many years. Still, recently I found myself wondering why I needed to build a configuration form if I already had a schema for my config. Defining a schema facilitates API-first validation (including some pretty smart constraints), specific typing (e.g. actual booleans or integers instead of '0' or '1' strings), and even translation in Drupal. That last part got me thinking; if Drupal automatically provides translation forms for typed configuration, why must I build a form? I started diving into the code and found config_translation_config_schema_info_alter() which maps certain config data types to element classes. The ConfigTranslationFormBase::buildForm() class fetches the schema for each config property from the 'config.typed' service ( \\Drupal\\Core\\Config\\TypedConfigManager ) before building the appropriate elements. So Drupal core automatically provides this translation form - notice the long textarea for the 'body' property: Read more SystemSeed Explores Human-Centered Design at DrupalCon Barcelona 2024 Posted by The Drop Times - 2 Oct 2024 at 13:50 UTC At DrupalCon Barcelona 2024, Elise West of SystemSeed presented a session on Human-Centered Design (HCD), explaining its growing relevance in Drupal projects. The session highlighted HCD’s role in aligning development with user needs, making it essential for project managers, developers, and product leads. More insights from SystemSeed's experience will follow. LN Webworks Amazing Experience at DrupalCon Barcelona 2024 Posted by LN Webworks - 2 Oct 2024 at 07:56 UTC As a Top-rated Drupal Development Company , attending DrupalCon Barcelona for the first time exceeded all of our expectations. The energy of the event was incredible, and it gave us the opportunity to connect with so many people in person. One of the standout moments was the inspiring StarShot initiative, whose marketing strategy makes a compelling case for businesses to consider Drupal as a solution. Starshot / Drupal CMS Product Strategy NO CODE website building, built on top of Drupal core itself. So, it will be easily able to beat the other no-code solutions like WIX, SQUARESPACE, and Shopify while still being able to maintain its open-source nature where you still will be able to have full control to customize and override things on your own. Vite and Storybook frontend tooling for Drupal Posted by PreviousNext - 1 Oct 2024 at 22:15 UTC We’ve just completed an extensive overhaul of our frontend tooling, with Vite and Storybook at the centre. Let’s go over it piece by piece. by jack.taranto / 2 October 2024 The goal of the overhaul was to modernise all aspects of the build stack, remove legacy dependencies and optimise development processes. Tooling is split into four pieces: asset building, styleguide, linting and testing. Asset building for Drupal with Vite We have always utilised two separate tools to build CSS and JS assets. Until now, this was PostCSS and Rollup, in the past Sass and Webpack have been in the mix. With Vite it’s one tool to build both types of assets. To introduce Vite to anyone not already familiar with it, I would say it’s a super fast version of Rollup without the configuration headaches. Moving to Vite sped up our development build times and production build times (in CI), simplified our config files and removed a huge number of NPM dependencies. Vite library mode A typical Vite build pipeline is most suitable for single-page apps. It involves an index.html file where Vite dynamically adds CSS and JS assets. However, with Drupal, we do not have an index.html file; we have the Drupal libraries system to load assets, with which Vite has no way of communicating.

Still on Drupal 7? Here Are Your Options: Migrate to the Latest Drupal Release Purchase Extended Security Support for Drupal 7 Notify Your Users of Your Plan Additional Resources Drupal 7 security support ends on 5 January 2025. This is the final extension of Drupal 7 end of life – Drupal 7 will not receive security updates after this date. But don’t worry! The Drupal Association and Drupal Security Team are providing resources, tools, and partners to empower you to migrate your Drupal 7 sites. This date marks 14 years since Drupal 7’s original release. While we’re proud of what Drupal 7 accomplished, we are looking forward to focusing resources on modern Drupal(Drupal 10, Drupal 11 and beyond!) What happens on 5 January 2025? After 5 January 2025, Drupal 7 will no longer receive security or compatibility updates. If you are still running Drupal 7 beyond this date, your website will be vulnerable to security risks and may face compatibility issues. Failure to address these issues can put your website out of compliance with FedRAMP, PCI, HIPAA, SOC 2, and other compliance standards. Still on Drupal 7? Here Are Your Options: Migrate to the Latest Drupal Release Migrating to the latest version of Drupal guarantees continuous support, security updates, and access to the newest features available on Drupal. The Drupal Association has identified several Certified Migration Partners who can help you perform the Drupal 7 migration. We have also organized a collection of valuable resources that may be helpful as you plan your migration efforts. Visit our Migration Resource Center and find a Certified Migration Partner Purchase Extended Security Support for Drupal 7 In an effort to provide the Drupal 7 community with security beyond the Drupal 7 end of life, the Drupal Association has created the Extended Security Support Provider Program. If migrating off of Drupal 7 before 5 January 2025 isn’t feasible, you can purchase extended security support for Drupal 7 from carefully vetted, certified vendors through this program. Currently, HeroDevs , Tag1 Consulting , and DropSolid are the certified vendors in the Extended Security Support Provider Program. View our D7 Extended Support partners. Notify Users of Your Plan If migrating to a newer version or using extended support isn't feasible right now, it’s essential to communicate your security strategy to your users. Make sure to inform your customers, managers, CISO, or other stakeholders about your plans for handling support and managing potential vulnerabilities. This transparency is important for maintaining trust and compliance. DIY Resources Migrating beyond Drupal 7 can be done your self and we have resources that might help users who choose to go with this plan.

Get your tickets now Find a Certified Partner About Drupal Certified Partners What it means to be a Drupal Certified Partner In late 2019, Dries Buytaert introduced the notion of “ Balancing Makers and Takers ” in a blog post. The overriding message is that Drupal needs significantly more contribution for the project to remain competitive in the longer term and that new models to incentivize and recognize contribution are required to achieve this. From this idea, the Drupal Certified Partners Program was created. The Drupal project is driven by a large global network of developers, designers, and other contributors that are constantly innovating the Drupal project. The Drupal Certified Partner recognizes and awards agencies that demonstrate significant innovation, philanthropic leadership and contribution to the Drupal project. These organizations are verified by the Drupal Association as Drupal Certified Partners on Drupal.org. As an open-source project the Drupal Certified Partner provides us with the necessary support to ensure security, accessibility and flexibility of the platform to meet enterprise level client innovation & scalability standards. Drupal Certified Partners are ambitious and have made Drupal a priority. Organizations are evaluated annually and awarded certification levels reflective of philanthropic and code contributions that they have made towards the project & the Drupal community. How to become a Drupal Certified Partner The Drupal Certified Partner program are organizations committed to the Drupal open-source project with a maker's mentality. Your engagement with this program is not meant to function solely as a marketing opportunity but instead as a values exchange rooted in your organization’s commitment to the community values of Drupal, to being a philanthropic supporter of the Drupal Association’s education and talent development programs, and to share the impact of innovating  the Drupal project for a collaborative and inclusive global future as a public benefit. A common attribute of Drupal Certified Partners is that they contribute  to deliver value for the Drupal project and to help the Drupal community.  You will find yourself among a community of peers who love Drupal and are working globally to use Drupal to keep the web safe and open for everyone.

Where do we start? The DA publishes how-to guides for developers and other forms of contribution and mentors may be available to assist with getting started. My client won’t approve a case study to be published publicly on Drupal.org. Will this affect my certification? No. Case studies can be submitted for the express purpose of certification without being published on Drupal.org. The Drupal Association will still need to verify each case study with the client in question or some other means of verification. Won’t the Certified Partner Program automatically favor bigger companies? The goal of the program is to drive the overall volume of quality contribution, spreading this effort amongst a larger number of companies. Under this model, any company with a strong contribution policy will easily qualify for the program, with the volume of their contribution determining what tier they qualify for. Can a small company achieve a high certification tier? Yes. If they meet the contribution requirements and pay the tier’s donation amount, any size company can achieve a high tier. Of course, a bigger team will mean it’s easier to achieve a higher volume of contribution credits, and the tiers will ultimately reflect a company’s overall capability to take on large scale projects. Can’t companies just “game” contribution credits to achieve a certification tier? Weighted contribution credits ensure that effort is directed to the aspects of Drupal that need the most work. How can I check if my company automatically qualifies as a Certified Partner? You can check drupal.org/drupal-services and see what your company’s current contribution volume is against the certification tiers listed in this FAQ. Will my company lose contribution credits if specific staff members who originally accrued the credits leave to join a new company? No. Credits are only assigned at the time that they’re originally attributed to a company. How are New Business leads managed by the Drupal Association? It’s anticipated that most leads will be organic based on certified partner listings for specific regions. E.g. Filter all certified partners in Germany. If the DA is contacted directly for partner recommendations, they can  provide links to certified partner profiles that match the criteria requested. E.g. Location, team size, customer experience. Does DrupalCon or other forms of community event sponsorship count towards contribution credits? Not currently, but this may be applicable in the future. What happens if a company pays a high donation but their contribution falls below the threshold for the tier they’ve paid? At the time of annual program renewal, the DA may need to interview the company to establish if their contribution level can be maintained to meet their tier requirements if they’ve fallen below the base threshold.

Be part of this landmark event as we celebrate and expand Drupal's impact across Asia. Get your tickets now Come for the Software, Stay for the Community Drupal is used, built, taught, documented, and marketed by the Drupal community, which is made up of people from around the world, with a shared set of values , collaborating together in a respectful manner . You are welcome to use the software and read the documentation as a visitor, but the hope of the Drupal community is that you will join in, find people who share your interests, and grow your skills ! Image courtesy Gábor Hojtsy A community of 100,000+ stories Everyone in the Drupal community has a story. We come from many backgrounds, with many skills and many perspectives -- but every month, more than 1500 people come together to improve the Drupal software, translations, documentation, and the community itself . Here are a few examples: Kevin Thull started recording sessions at DrupalCamp Chicago in 2013, and developed a kit for other DrupalCamps to use xjm started out fixing bugs in the TAC contributed module, and is now a Drupal Core maintainer Melissa Anderson started using Drupal, joined her local Drupal user group meetup, and ended up managing the Great Git Migration project And there are many more stories Ready to join in? The community is working on a new Contributor Guide to help you figure out how to use your particular skills to contribute to the Drupal project and add your story to the Drupal community. You can contribute as much or as little time as you want -- some tasks may be as quick as a few minutes, and some roles can span years. Not convinced yet? In general, people volunteer their time because it is fun, interesting, challenging, and engaging; because it can help them improve their skills or reputation; and because it is meaningful. Here are some thoughts about how contributing to the Drupal project and community fits with those goals: Synergy The more we work together, the more we all benefit from having better software, documentation, translations, and community. Reporting or fixing a problem you have found improves the software, documentation, or translation you are using, which helps you and the rest of the community -- and inspires others to contribute. Practice and improve your skills Whether it’s coding, user interface design, graphic design, writing, or organizing, if you’re looking for practice, there’s a task for you! There are also opportunities to practice leadership and management skills, such as resolving conflicts, organizing teams of people, and prioritizing work. Find mentors and teach others Working with others on a shared project means you’ll have to explain how you do things, as well as ask other people for help. The acts of learning and teaching can be a fulfilling activity for everyone involved. Meet people with similar interests The Drupal community spans the globe, and many people form lifelong friendships through their participation in the Drupal community, whether it’s running into each other at conferences or late night online chats about burritos. Build public artifacts that help you grow a reputation (and a career) Drupal is an open-source project, so all of work is public, which means you get free examples to take anywhere as a demonstration of what you can do. Many contributors also look at Drupal project contributions when making hiring decisions for Drupal-related jobs. Browse the Contributor Guide to find out how to use your particular skills to contribute to the Drupal project. Community Connections The community organizes itself into topical and geographic groups on https://groups.drupal.org . A few groups also have spaces here: Community Working Group The mission of the Community Working Group (CWG) is to foster a friendly and welcoming community for the Drupal project and to uphold the Drupal Code of Conduct. Read more at the Community Working Group Section. Nonprofit Drupal If you work in a nonprofit using Drupal, or you work with nonprofits using Drupal, this is the community group for you! Drupal Diversity & Inclusion Our purpose: To continue the conversation about diversity and inclusion within Drupal! Promote Drupal Drupal agencies span the globe, working with varied industries and audiences, but with one common goal: we are all working to grow Drupal adoption. If you're promoting Drupal in your market, here are marketing materials, content, and resources for your use. Mentoring The Drupal Mentoring team is a working group that supports mentors at daily bases, organizes follow-up activities and helps the Drupal Association to manage mentoring in the community. Contribution Events The Contribution Events initiative seeks to promote contribution events worldwide. Event Organizers The Event Organizers' Group supports people who organize Drupal related events around the World Local Associations Local Drupal Associations organize regional efforts, promote local business, support local camps, and to help coordinate with the global Drupal Association. IXP fellowships IXP Fellowships are an initiative to provide incentives to companies who train inexperienced developers (pre-Junior) - and reward them even if those new developers move to different roles. Here are some other ways to get involved with the Drupal community, and get help with various issues you may have: I want help installing and using Drupal Installing and first using Drupal can, at first, seem to be a daunting prospect, but there are resources to help you, and you can also evaluate and test Drupal without even needing to install it. Drupal documentation is constantly evolving. You can learn about getting started at: The official Drupal 8 User Guide has a section on installation of the Drupal software. The Drupal 8 Evaluator Guide shows you how to get a demo Drupal website up and running quickly. You can connect with other members of the Drupal community by: Posting questions on the Drupal section on Stack Exchange Watching videos on YouTube and other video repositories. See the collection of videos from past DrupalCon events , especially Asking questions in the Drupal Forums for installing and then using Drupal Instant messaging tools, such as Slack (sign up, then join channel(s) #support ) and DrupalChat.me (sign up, then join channel(s) #drupal_support ). Meeting people face to face at an event local to you. You can find Drupal events at drupical.com . I want to connect with members of the Drupal community who live or work nearby Finding a local Drupal group that is active in your region, or starting up or reuniting an inactive group, is a way to connect with others using Drupal, contribute to the community, and grow, personally and professionally. To find a local or regional group: Start by looking at the list of regional groups on groups.drupal.org (but note that the keyword search is not currently working on this page -- you may be better off using your favorite web search engine). Some regional Drupal groups and language communities use instant messaging tools, such as Slack (sign up and browse the channel list) and DrupalChat.me (sign up, then browse the channel list). Many Drupal language communities have their own web sites, forums, and chat channels, where you can connect with others who speak your language. Visit https://www.drupal.org/language-specific-communities to find these communities. You might want to attend an event in your area. You can find Drupal events at https://drupical.com . If you are new to Drupal, a Global Training Days event might be a good choice. Some local communities and regional events have their own websites, use meetup.com, or are active on other social media. Try a web search to find them. You can also find nearby community members in the Drupal Association Individual Member Directory . This list isn’t all encompassing; however, it is a group of members who actively support the work of the Drupal Association. There is also a list of organizations using Drupal , which you can filter by country. This section is still under discussion - you can help here: #3005613: Add Section Heading “I want to connect with members of the Drupal community who live or work nearby” I want to report a software or documentation bug that I have found If you find a problem with the Drupal software or documentation, it will be a great benefit to the Drupal community if you report it, so it can be fixed or addressed. Each project on Drupal.org (Drupal core, modules, themes, and distributions) has its own public area for issue tracking, known as an issue queue , where anyone can report and collaborate on fixing issues (learn more at Overview of projects and issues ). There is also a project called \"Documentation\", where issues with the documentation on Drupal.org are located. Note that you should not report issues by contacting the software maintainers via email, contact forms, or social media. Using the issue tracking system helps to ensure that a permanent, public record of the issue is kept, including the conversation about how best to address it. Where to report issues: Security issues are handled in a separate, confidential issue queue, to ensure that they are fixed before vulnerabilities become public. Read about Reporting a security problem Documentation on drupal.org : you can edit the documentation directly if you have something to add, correct, or clarify. If you're unsure, add your correction as a comment instead. API documentation on api.drupal.org : The API documentation is generated from specially-formatted comments in the code, so issues are reported in the same way as Software issues (see next line). Software : see Finding the issues for a project -- always report issues in the relevant project. Note that some projects rely on third-party libraries that are maintained elsewhere. Issues related to those libraries need to be reported to the maintainers of those libraries using their established issue procedures. You can start by reporting an issue in the Drupal project that uses the library; the Drupal project maintainer may ask you to report the issue elsewhere. Drupal.org web site : see Get Help Translations : The team for the affected language on Drupal.org's localization server Drupal documentation is constantly evolving. You can read about issue reporting and project maintenance processes at: Guide to issues -- this section goes into more detail about issues and issue queues Drupal core maintainers -- explains the roles and responsibilities of the Drupal core software maintainers Maintainership guide -- explains the responsibilities of contributed project maintainers You can connect with other members of the Drupal community, collaborating on issues, through: The issue queues (the issue queue for Drupal core is a good example) Instant messaging tools, such as Slack (sign up, then join channel(s) #support , #contribute , or #documentation ) and DrupalChat.me (sign up, then join channel(s) #drupal-support ).

If you're interested in specific issues regarding governance, take a look in the issue queue and add more if you'd like. The repository holds a collection of charters relating to Drupal community working groups those managed by the Project Lead and under the Drupal Association.

Preview upcoming Drupal core features Automatic Updates and Project Browser are two key upcoming features for Drupal 10 that are being built as contributed modules. Automatic Updates module applies patch-level updates to Drupal core in a separate, sandboxed copy of your site, to keep you up and running until the update is completely ready to be deployed. It can detect and report problems at every stage of the update process, so you don't have to find out about them after an update is live. It automatically detects database updates in an incoming update, and helps you run them during the process. Project Browser makes it easy for site builders to find modules and themes. Once a project is selected, instructions are provided on how to install the extension on your site. The browser lives inside the Drupal site itself on a new Browse tab under Extend. This means you don't need to leave your site in order to look for projects.

Please consider supporting Ukraine in a fight for their freedom and safety of Europe. Developer module that provides a place to upload external javascript plugins and libraries so the same library can be used by multiple modules. The common denominator for all Drupal modules/profiles/themes that integrate with external libraries. This module introduces a common repository for libraries in sites/all/libraries resp. sites/<domain>/libraries for contributed modules. External libraries Denotes libraries ( \"plugins\" ) that are neither shipped nor packaged with a project on drupal.org.  We do not want to host third-party libraries on drupal.org for a multitude of reasons, starting with licensing, proceeding to different release cycles, and not necessarily ending with fatal errors due to conflicts of having the same library installed in multiple versions. Drupal 7 only has built-in support for non-external libraries via hook_library().  But it  is only suitable for drupal.org projects that bundle their own library; i.e., the module author is the creator and vendor of the library.  Libraries API should be used for externally developed and distributed libraries.  A simple example would be a third-party jQuery plugin.

CKEditor 4 officially reached its end-of-life in 2023 CKEditor 4 officially reached its end-of-life in 2023, after more than a decade. Migration to CKEditor 5 is recommended. CKEditor 5 is available in Drupal 9.5+. CKEditor 4 LTS with security updates available until December 2026 If for any reason you can't upgrade to CKEditor 5 and you are interested in getting security updates for CKEditor 4 up until December 2026, please check the CKEditor 4 LTS module , where a special edition, CKEditor 4 LTS (\"Long Term Support\"), is available under commercial terms (\"Extended Support Model\") for anyone looking to extend the coverage of security updates and critical bug fixes. It provides the same functionality as this module and is backwards compatible. What is CKEditor? CKEditor is the far superior successor of FCKeditor. The editor has been rebranded and completely rewritten. It is now much faster (the code has been optimized), loads faster (the number of files has been reduced, so the browser will perform less HTTP requests) and developer-friendly.

You like the default taxonomy/term view, but you find you want to sort it differently; for example, alphabetically. You use /tracker, but you want to restrict it to posts of a certain type. You like the idea of the 'article' module, but it doesn't display articles the way you like. You want a way to display a block with the 5 most recent posts of some particular type. You want to provide 'unread forum posts'. You want a monthly archive similar to the typical Movable Type/Wordpress archives that displays a link to the in the form of \"Month, YYYY (X)\" where X is the number of posts that month, and displays them in a block. The links lead to a simple list of posts for that month. Views can do a lot more than that, but those are some of the obvious uses of Views. Views for Drupal 8 Views is in Drupal 8 core! Please open all Views-related issues for your D8 sites in the Drupal core issue queue .

Radix is a heavily opinionated theme, so you might not agree, if you feel like arguing about anything, please create an issue on drupal.org so we can talk it over. but over the years many other themes and projects started as a fork of Radix, so we've been doing something right probably. With Radix 6.x and Drupal ^10.1, we now support the core SDC and don't require the great components module anymore. We are also using the new Drupal core's starterkit process to create our subthemes, even though it wasn't necessary, it sounds cool on the README, so why not? but that's under the hood stuff.

Work with a mentor who can share their experience, support your learning, and help you understand what a career in open-source could look like. Attend DrupalCon, the largest annual gathering of Drupal experts and enthusiasts for free. Meet potential employers and learn about internships or job opportunities that match your interests. Purpose Open Source has historically been exclusionary for marginalized people, and the talent gap for junior developers is widening. Discover Drupal aims to uplift marginalized folks and close the talent gap by providing the necessary resources, skills, and connections for our students to be successful. This initiative provides Drupal training scholarships, mentorship, and hands-on experience to folks who are interested in pursuing a career in Drupal and are from historically oppressed communities. Students that complete the program will be ready for an internship or early-career level position. Our 2021-2022 cohort graduated 4 students, and our 2022-2023 cohort graduated 6 students. We are thrilled to continue empowering marginalized people in technology through Drupal. We will be taking 2023-2024 as a strategic visioning year, and we need your support. Please see our full statement on ReDiscovering Drupal on the Drupal Association blog: ReDiscovering Discover Drupal For any questions or comments about Discover Drupal, reach out to Joi Garrett , Programs Manager at joi@association.drupal.org .

Get your tickets now Drupal Swag Shop The Drupal Swag Shop is a community-managed online store for purchasing Drupal-branded merchandise. The Swag Shop Working Group have configured the store to pass all profits directly to the Drupal Association. Take me to the swag! Frequently Asked Questions What is the Drupal Swag Shop? Drupal Swag Shop is an initiative to offer sustainably sourced Drupal branded merchandise that both promotes Drupal and generates revenue for the Drupal Association. Why isn't the Drupal Swag Shop built in Drupal? This is because we want to keep all investment, risk and overhead as low as we can while we test the concept. Using the Spreadshirt platform enables us to do this while still controlling things like pricing and share of revenue to Drupal Association. Building a website is only part of running an online store - the greatest work is often in the fulfilment processes and, in this iteration, Spreadshirt manages that entirely. Where is my order? One of the considerations for choosing a swag shop partner was to ensure a clear and responsive customer service process. Spreadshirt manage the supply chain from taking your order and printing the swag through to delivering to your door, so if you have any problems with your order, you can contact them through the following channels: If you shopped from the US, Canada, Australia shop Click on the ‘track my order’ button on your order confirmation email Email service@spreadshirt.com Telephone +1 800 381 0815 (Mon - Fri: 9am - 6pm ET) If you shopped from the European shop Click on the ‘track my order’ button on your order confirmation email Email service@spreadshirt.co.uk Telephone +44 20 3966 1818 (Mo - Fr: 8am - 5pm) Will there be more designs available in the swap shop? A very big YES! The swag shop working group has agreed a process for gaining approval from the Drupal Association for new designs in addition to those already available. Examples include DrupalCon and DrupalCamp logos, but there is no reason why we can’t get more creative with the designs. If you have ideas you would like to suggest, simply add an issue to the Drupal Swag Shop project . Where does the Swag Shop deliver to? Spreadshirt delivers to over 190 countries around the world. You can check delivery options and prices here for orders from the USA, Canada and Australia shop and here for the UK/ Europe shop . Why doesn’t my country appear in the “deliver to” option? To be able to deliver globally, Spreadshirt print products from operations in the US and Europe. When you enter the Drupal swag shop, you will normally be asked which shop you want (see screenshot below). This will direct you to the right store based on your location. For example, if you are from Brazil, you will be directed to the US shop, whereas if you are from India, you will be directed to the European store. Can I return items I have ordered if I am not happy with them? Every item you order from the Drupal Swag Shop is printed for you on-demand by hand. This means returned items aren’t put back into stock, as we can’t resell them. however we want to make sure you’re 100% content with your order and Spreadshirt offers a 30-day Return Guarantee. If it doesn’t fit or you don’t like it, simply return your product within 30 days of your receipt date. As a print-on-demand provider, Spreadshirt can offer you the following return options: Exchange for a new product Exchange for a voucher which can be redeemed towards your next order How can I help? To ensure the Drupal Swag Shop is a sustainable project, we are actively seeking maintainers to help. There is not a huge investment of time required but we want a big enough working group to ensure we keep thing moving. Please come along to our Drupal project page , create an issue there offering help and we will get in touch!

Join today Curated Guides Evaluator Guide Local Development Guide User Guide Appendix Local Development Guide Goals The purpose of this guide is to assist you with creating and installing a new Drupal application on your local machine for the purpose of development. Installing Drupal using the following instructions will give you a starting point for a website that can be deployed to a production environment. The intended audience for this guide is a developer. Evaluating Drupal? Create a disposable Drupal demo application to evaluate Drupal’s capabilities and codebase. Prerequisites You should be comfortable using a command-line terminal. See Moving Around the Command Line video tutorial . Sufficient system privileges to download and install new software. DDEV is a Docker -based tool that provides a preconfigured local development environment for Drupal. Install Docker for your OS before attempting to install DDEV. Local development with DDEV This guide provides instructions for installing Drupal’s system requirements by using a free, cross-platform local development solution, DDEV . Many viable local development environment solutions exist. Note: DDEV requires Docker. To install DDEV, see DDEV installation documentation . Configure your local development environment to serve your application Replace my-site with a machine-friendly (no spaces or special punctuation) name for your new application and run the following command (assumes DDEV): mkdir my-site\ncd my-site\nddev config --project-type drupal --docroot web This will create a new DDEV project configured to host a Drupal application. DDEV will store the generated configuration in a new .ddev subdirectory. Project name will be the same as the parent folder ( my-site ), define it with --project-name solrcloud . Next, start the DDEV container ddev start You now have a web server and database server configured and running. Configuring DDEV first allows us to run Composer from within DDEV instead of installing it locally. Create a new Drupal application Next, use Composer to install Drupal, which enables you to install and update dependencies (modules, themes, profiles, libraries, etc.) also with Composer. It is best practice to ensure that your entire Drupal application is managed with Composer in order to facilitate manageable upgrades. Now create a new Drupal application with Composer. Note: ddev composer create will unpack and download the files into the current folder, unlike composer create-project which downloads Drupal into a separate folder. ddev composer create drupal/recommended-project -y It is possible to install Drupal with Composer without using the DDEV environment, but not recommended, since PHP versions in DDEV and your local environment may differ. composer create-project drupal/recommended-project You now have a web server and database server configured and running. Install Drupal Next, you must install Drupal using Drush, which populates your Drupal application’s new database. First, install the latest version of Drush, a command-line utility for Drupal. ddev composer require drush/drush Using DDEV and Drush, execute the command below. ddev drush site:install -y Drupal is now installed, with an automatically generated password for the user #1 account (Administrator) . User name and password for user #1 can be specified with --account-name=myusername --account-pass=my-password . Log In Finally, launch your new Drupal site and log in. ddev launch You can also generate a one-time login link for the administrator account (user id #1). ddev drush user:login If necessary, execute ddev describe to view the URL of your site. Copy and paste that URL into your web browser to visit it. Next steps What now? Learn how you can begin to extend and customize your new Drupal application. Visit the Drupal User Guide and read the following chapters: Chapter 4. Basic Site Configuration Chapter 5. Basic Page Management Chapter 6. Setting Up Content Structure Appendix We chose to use DDEV for this local development guide because it met the following criteria: Must be free and open source, without tying users into a proprietary product or service. Must be well maintained, with long term support. Must follow Drupal best practices. Must be compatible with MacOS, Windows, and Linux. Must be as simple as possible Fewest pre-requisites Fewest manual steps To suggest a different local development solution, please create an issue in the Official Docs issue queue .

Join today Curated Guides Evaluator Guide Local Development Guide User Guide Appendix Evaluator Guide Goals This guide provides instructions for creating a temporary Drupal demo application that can be used to evaluate Drupal on your local machine. The demo application is unsuitable for live websites and should be used for demonstration purposes only. There are many alternative methods of creating a Drupal site. This guide aims to provide one way that works for most people. Read the Drupal User Guide if you’d prefer to begin building a custom Drupal application that can be used for a live website. If you cannot access the command line interface or are not comfortable using it to install software as described below, you can test Drupal at Simplytest . Your test site will be available for 30 minutes. The admin username is admin and the password is admin . Alternatively, consider trying a free, hosted solution for your evaluation. Requirements In order to install and run a Drupal demo application on your local machine, your system must include: An available command line interface PHP 8.3+ To verify that you have PHP installed and that it meets the minimum version requirement, you can run php -v in your command line interface. You only need PHP, not a complete stack with database and webserver. Windows users can download it from windows.php.net or install it with Chocolatey . MacOS users can install it with Homebrew Debian-flavor Linux users can run sudo apt install php8.3 Other Linux distributions and systems, see installation page of the PHP manual . Download Drupal To download Drupal, open your command line interface. For Mac & Linux , execute the following commands: mkdir drupal\ncd drupal\ncurl -sSL https://www.drupal.org/download-latest/tar.gz | tar -xz --strip-components=1 These commands will create a new drupal directory, change into it, and download and decompress a compressed copy of the latest recommended version of Drupal into that new directory. For Windows Manually download the zip file for the latest recommended version of Drupal and decompress it. cd the into the resultant directory on the command line. Install Drupal & Log In Next, execute the following command: php -d memory_limit=256M core/scripts/drupal quick-start demo_umami This will start a built-in PHP webserver , install Drupal’s Umami profile to a SQLite database , and open your web browser to log in to the new Drupal site. If you are not automatically logged in you can find the username and password in the output from the above command. If you’d like to learn more about Drupal’s built-in quick-start command, execute: php core/scripts/drupal quick-start --help What’s Next You’re now logged in (as an administrator) to the demo application. You are free to experiment with Drupal and acquaint yourself with its many features. When you’re ready to get started with building your own Drupal application, visit the Drupal User Guide . Once you plan to do any local development or site building, read the local development guide . Cleaning up After stopping the demo application, you can clean up completely by just deleting the application directory: cd ..\nchmod -R u+w drupal/sites\nrm -rf drupal Drupal’s online documentation is © 2000-2024 by the individual contributors and can be used in accordance with the Creative Commons License, Attribution-ShareAlike 2.0 .

Join today Curated Guides Evaluator Guide Local Development Guide User Guide Appendix Evaluator Guide Goals This guide provides instructions for creating a temporary Drupal demo application that can be used to evaluate Drupal on your local machine. The demo application is unsuitable for live websites and should be used for demonstration purposes only. There are many alternative methods of creating a Drupal site. This guide aims to provide one way that works for most people. Read the Drupal User Guide if you’d prefer to begin building a custom Drupal application that can be used for a live website. If you cannot access the command line interface or are not comfortable using it to install software as described below, you can test Drupal at Simplytest . Your test site will be available for 30 minutes. The admin username is admin and the password is admin . Alternatively, consider trying a free, hosted solution for your evaluation. Requirements In order to install and run a Drupal demo application on your local machine, your system must include: An available command line interface PHP 8.3+ To verify that you have PHP installed and that it meets the minimum version requirement, you can run php -v in your command line interface. You only need PHP, not a complete stack with database and webserver. Windows users can download it from windows.php.net or install it with Chocolatey . MacOS users can install it with Homebrew Debian-flavor Linux users can run sudo apt install php8.3 Other Linux distributions and systems, see installation page of the PHP manual . Download Drupal To download Drupal, open your command line interface. For Mac & Linux , execute the following commands: mkdir drupal\ncd drupal\ncurl -sSL https://www.drupal.org/download-latest/tar.gz | tar -xz --strip-components=1 These commands will create a new drupal directory, change into it, and download and decompress a compressed copy of the latest recommended version of Drupal into that new directory. For Windows Manually download the zip file for the latest recommended version of Drupal and decompress it. cd the into the resultant directory on the command line. Install Drupal & Log In Next, execute the following command: php -d memory_limit=256M core/scripts/drupal quick-start demo_umami This will start a built-in PHP webserver , install Drupal’s Umami profile to a SQLite database , and open your web browser to log in to the new Drupal site. If you are not automatically logged in you can find the username and password in the output from the above command. If you’d like to learn more about Drupal’s built-in quick-start command, execute: php core/scripts/drupal quick-start --help What’s Next You’re now logged in (as an administrator) to the demo application. You are free to experiment with Drupal and acquaint yourself with its many features. When you’re ready to get started with building your own Drupal application, visit the Drupal User Guide . Once you plan to do any local development or site building, read the local development guide . Cleaning up After stopping the demo application, you can clean up completely by just deleting the application directory: cd ..\nchmod -R u+w drupal/sites\nrm -rf drupal Drupal’s online documentation is © 2000-2024 by the individual contributors and can be used in accordance with the Creative Commons License, Attribution-ShareAlike 2.0 .

Make sure you have composer installed on your local machine before executing any Composer commands. For information on managing development dependencies read further: about installing Core's require-dev packages with Composer see the relevant section in Starting a Site Using Drupal Composer Project Templates ; about npm (JavaScript) see Frontend developer tools for Drupal core . Download Drupal core using Composer As of the release of Drupal 8.8.0 - the recommend composer template changed from drupal-composer/drupal-project to the officially supported: drupal/recommended-project To get the current release of Drupal, use the composer template at drupal/recommended-project . This template ensures Drupal Core dependencies are the exact same version as the latest official Drupal release. Other approaches can be found below. For Drupal 7, use drupal-composer/drupal-project . Create a project For the latest stable version of Drupal: composer create-project drupal/recommended-project my_site_name For Drupal 7: composer create-project drupal-composer/drupal-project:7.x-dev -n my_site_name This will create a project in the my_site_name directory and automatically executes composer install to download the latest stable version of Drupal and all its dependencies. The my_site_name directory will contain files that should be outside of your web root and not accessible by the web server. The web root will be the my_site_name/web directory, and typically the full path to that directory will be used as DocumentRoot (if you are using the Apache webserver). Note that the above command will download the current official release of Drupal. If you want a different version, add the version number to the command after a colon. For example, to download version 9.3.12: composer create-project drupal/recommended-project:9.3.12 my_site_name All releases can be found at https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases . For the latest 9.3 version, use drupal/recommended-project:^9.3 in the above command, or drupal/recommended-project:^9 for latest Drupal 9 version. Installing with composer via docker You might be using a docker based workflow and therefore do not have composer and its dependencies already installed. If this is the case then you can create the drupal project with this command: docker run --rm -i --tty -v $PWD:/app composer create-project drupal/recommended-project my_site_name --ignore-platform-reqs Install Drupal using the standard web interface After composer finishes downloading the packages, you can navigate your browser to your site's url and start the setup. It'll ask for the database credentials, a name for the admin user and some basic information. Install Drupal using the command line You can use Drush to install Drupal from the command line. Add Drush in your project by running: composer require drush/drush and use drush site:install to run the command line setup wizard. Without any arguments it'll install the standard profile and ask only for database credentials. drush site:install If you are evaluating Drupal and just want to see a site, you might try the quickstart feature . After creating the project you could type php ./web/core/scripts/drupal quick-start demo_umami and see a demo site. To do a modified install If you want to modify some of the properties of the downloaded composer.json before composer install is executed, use the --no-install flag when running composer create-project . For example, it is possible that you want to rename the subdirectory 'web' to something else. To do that: Run composer create-project --no-install drupal/recommended-project my_site_name Change directories to my_site_name and edit the composer.json file to suit your needs. For example, to change the sub-directory from 'web' to something else, the keys to modify are the 'extra' sub-keys 'web-root' (under 'drupal-scaffold') and 'installer-paths'. Run composer install to download Drupal and all its dependencies. If you are used to building Drupal site via Drush make, refer to the FAQs in Drupal's Composer template documentation to learn the difference between this option and Drush make. Download contributed modules, themes and their dependencies using Composer It is increasingly common that contributed Drupal modules have dependencies to third party libraries. Some of these modules can only be installed using Composer. If you downloaded Drupal core using Composer, or if one of your modules requires Composer, you should also use Composer to download all modules and themes using Composer. Sites may encounter critical update problems if they mix Composer updates and other update methods. This chapter has the following sub-sections: Download contributed modules and themes using Composer Define the directories to which Drupal projects should be downloaded if needed Download contributed modules and themes using Composer To download contributed Drupal modules or themes with composer: Run composer require drupal/module_name For example: composer require drupal/token This needs to be executed at the root of your Drupal install but not at the same level as the core directory. Composer will then automatically update your composer.json, adding the module to all the other requirements in the list, like this: {\n    \"require\": {\n        \"drupal/token\": \"^1.5\"\n    }\n} Composer will download the module and all the possible dependencies it may have. You can enable the Drupal module in two ways: By using the standard Drupal web-browser interface. Using a command line tool like Drush or Drupal Console - see Installing Modules from the Command Line . You can use either the project name, or the specific module name within a project when requiring modules: Composer will download the whole project that contains a particular module. For example, if you need the fe_block module from the features_extra project you can do either from the following options: composer require drupal/features_extra composer require drupal/fe_block Specifying a version You can specify the version of the module / theme you want to download as follows: composer require 'drupal/module_name:version' (...where version is replaced with a Composer version or version constraint.) For example: composer require 'drupal/token:^1.5' \ncomposer require 'drupal/simple_fb_connect:~3.0' \ncomposer require 'drupal/ctools:3.0.0-alpha26' \ncomposer require 'drupal/token:1.x-dev' To avoid problems on different terminals/shells, surround the version in quotes as in the examples above. Note! : On Windows, the (single) quotes actually might break the version specification and lead to failure to install with ' Could not parse version constraint .....': Invalid version string \"....'\" . Without the quotes, e.g.: composer require drupal/ctools:^3.7 or with double quotes instead of single quotes, e.g.: composer require \"drupal/ctools:^3.7\" it works well. See Comment 'Composer problems: \"could not parse version constraint\"' . In the above examples, the versions map as follows: ^1.5: maps to the latest stable 8.x-1.x release of the module. ~3.0: maps to the latest stable 8.x-3.x release of the module. 3.0.0-alpha26: maps to version 8.x-3.0-alpha26 1.x-dev: maps to 8.x-1.x-dev For more on version constraints with ~ (tilde) and ^ (caret) see Next Significant Release Operators . It is recommended to indicate the version of the contributed module that you want to download. In the example above, Simple FB Connect can be updated to a later version of the 8.x-3.x branch but Composer will not automatically update to 8.x-4.x if it would be released. Using dev versions Development releases contain changes which their maintainers have not put into a tagged release. They may not be stable, may not have an upgrade path, and any security issues that are only present in dev releases can be disclosed publicly. It is strongly recommend that you use tagged releases of modules rather than development versions, however in some cases you may find it necessary to use a dev version. Because dev versions are pure git clones, they do not have additional version information provided by Drupal.org. This means update manager in Drupal core will not function properly for modules installed with dev versions. To resolve this, you can install the Composer Deploy project. About semantic versioning Drupal.org contributed projects are currently not versioned with true semantic versioning. However, the Composer service on Drupal.org translates the Contrib project version schema into a semver format that Composer can understand. This 'semver shim' will also allow Drupal.org to be flexible if the versioning standard for Contrib changes. The key element to this shim is that each major version of Drupal Core has a separate endpoint, to prevent collisions between the D7 version of a module and the D8 version Example D7 Endpoint Version Mapping Current Format Translated Format {Platform.x}-{major}.{minor}-{stability#} {major}.{minor}.0-{stability}{#} 7.x-3.4-beta2 3.4.0-beta2 7.x-2.10-rc2 2.10.0-rc2 7.x-1.0-unstable3 unstable releases will not be translated, and not available to composer 7.x-1.0-alpha5 1.0.0-alpha5 7.x-0.1-rc2 0.1.0-rc2 7.x-1.x-dev 1.x-dev Using Composer search Drupal.org's composer endpoints support the Composer search function - so you can also search for Drupal projects from the command line. The format for using Composer search is: composer search views Using Composer browse Drupal.org's composer endpoints support the Composer browse function - so you can find additional information about Drupal projects from the command line. The format for using Composer browse is: composer browse drupal/token Define the directories to which modules, themes, libraries, etc. should be downloaded If you want to change the locations in the file system where packages are installed, you can modify the \"installer-paths\" section of the composer.json file. This also can be useful if you need to have specific packages installed in their own locations. This approach uses the composer/installers package and uses configuration such as this: \"extra\": {\n    \"installer-paths\": {\n        \"core\": [\"type:drupal-core\"],\n        \"libraries/{$name}\": [\"type:drupal-library\"],\n        \"modules/contrib/{$name}\": [\"type:drupal-module\"],\n        \"profiles/contrib/{$name}\": [\"type:drupal-profile\"],\n        \"themes/contrib/{$name}\": [\"type:drupal-theme\"],\n        \"drush/{$name}\": [\"type:drupal-drush\"],\n        \"modules/custom/{$name}\": [\"type:drupal-custom-module\"],\n        \"themes/custom/{$name}\": [\"type:drupal-custom-theme\"]\n    }\n} Note: Custom modules and themes paths requires composer/installers package v1.0.24 and up. In addition to the package type-based installation locations you can use vendor specific ones, like this: \"extra\": {\n    \"installer-paths\": {\n        \"web/libraries/ckeditor/plugins/{$name}\": [\"vendor:ckeditor-plugin\"]\n    }\n} Or package specific ones, like this: \"extra\": {\n    \"installer-paths\": {\n        \"web/libraries/{$name}\": [ \"enyo/dropzone\" ]\n    }\n} Note: If a particular package matches multiple installer-paths entries, the first one that matches will be used. See the composer/installers documentation at https://github.com/composer/installers for more information on how you can use this feature. Downloading third-party libraries using Composer Many Drupal distributions are adopting Asset Packagist as a vehicle to download, install, and manage third-party Javascript and CSS packages into Drupal's libraries folder. Please note that Asset Packagist may not work with all imaginable third-party packages, and only supports those that have been indexed in NPM or Bower. (The Asset Packagist website provides a search mechanism to find supported packages). In general, it is not recommended to use Composer for managing dependencies in pure front-end applications, as NPM, Webpack, and Yarn are currently better suited to that task. In other words, only use Asset Packagist if your primary application is a PHP-based server-side app like Drupal, which depends on other smaller non-PHP libraries. For Javascript dependencies that are not indexed by NPM or Bower, you may find that you can adapt this recipe on managing CKEditor plugins with Composer to your needs. The recipe for setting up Asset Packagist for use in your projects is as follows: Add the Composer Installers Extender PHP package by oomphinc to your project's root composer.json file, by running the following command: composer require oomphinc/composer-installers-extender Add Asset Packagist to the \"repositories\" section of your project's root composer.json. \"repositories\": [\n    {\n        \"type\": \"composer\",\n        \"url\": \"https://asset-packagist.org\"\n    }\n] Ensure that NPM and Bower assets are registered as new \"installer-types\" and, in addition to type:drupal-library, they are registered in \"installer-paths\" to be installed into Drupal's /libraries folder, within the \"extra\" section of your project's root composer.json file. \"extra\": {\n    \"installer-types\": [\n        \"npm-asset\",\n        \"bower-asset\"\n    ],\n    \"installer-paths\": {\n        \"web/libraries/{$name}\": [\n            \"type:drupal-library\",\n            \"type:npm-asset\",\n            \"type:bower-asset\"\n        ]\n    }\n} The installation path of a specific library can be controlled by adding it to the \"installer-paths\" configuration above the general configuration. For example, the chosen module expects the library at /libraries/chosen, but composer require npm-asset/chosen-js installs the library into /libraries/chosen-js; the following override installs it into the expected folder: \"extra\": {\n    \"installer-paths\": {\n        \"web/libraries/chosen\": [\"npm-asset/chosen-js\"],\n        \"web/libraries/{$name}\": [\n            \"type:drupal-library\",\n            \"type:npm-asset\",\n            \"type:bower-asset\"\n        ]\n    }\n} You may now require libraries from NPM or Bower via Composer on the command line: composer require bower-asset/leaflet:1.0.3 composer require npm-asset/chosen-js:^1.8 Contrib and custom modules may include these dependencies in their own respective composer.json files. See Requiring third-party libraries with Composer for additional instructions. Managing existing sites using Composer This chapter applies to Drupal 8 sites that were originally installed without using Composer. Download contributed modules and themes using Composer If you initially created your Drupal website without Composer (for example by manually downloading and extracting a tarball / zip file), you will need to modify your composer.json by adding drupal.org as Composer repository and by defining the directory where modules should be downloaded. You can use the Composerize Drupal plugin for Composer to automatically generate an updated composer.json for you. It will add contributed modules, themes, and profiles that it discovers in your existing site. The Composerize module can \"generate a composer.json from your installed Drupal code base, which can be used to regenerate that code base by running composer install .\" Alternatively, you can manually modify your composer.json file. Read: Using packages.drupal.org (as Composer repository) Define the directories to which Drupal projects should be downloaded if needed Note: You should modify the composer.json file that is at the root of your repository, not core/composer.json or the composer.json that may exist at the same level as the core directory. See \" Add Composer to existing sites \" for a step by step guide to manually adding composer to existing Drupal 8 sites that were previously installed without Composer. Updating Drupal sites using Composer For updating a Drupal site using Composer: Update core via Composer Update modules and themes via Composer Once Composer is used to manage a single module, it also means that Composer needs to be used to manage and update Drupal core. The reason for this is that manual Drupal core updates replace the 'vendor' directory, removing the downloaded libraries required by the contributed module. Patching projects using Composer You can automatically apply patches to composer-built dependencies using cweagans/composer-patches . See the project's README.md file for specific instructions. composer require cweagans/composer-patches:~1.0 --update-with-dependencies Note that the 2.x (master) branch of cweagans/composer-patches is the development branch and not intended for public usage. For instance patchLevel might be missing , required to patch Drupal core. Note that patching a project's .info.yml file(s) is a little more complex, requiring a workaround. Warning : Hotlinking to remotely hosted patches, whether on Drupal.org or another service is not recommended. A remotely hosted patch file might become inaccessible due to an outage, or even deletion, and in a worse case scenario the contents of a remotely hosted patch file can be changed which creates a risk of malicious code. For the integrity of your build chain, it is best practice to commit your patch files to a local repository. Patching Drupal core and modules On projects following the recommended webroot structure for core, applying core patches with cweagans/composer-patches needs to happen using the p2 patch level (i.e. to reach inside the webroot directory when the project composer.json is a level above that). Patches that simply add files can technically apply at any level, but that can mean the files get created in the wrong place. To ensure they get applied in the right place, add the following definitions to your composer.json, in the extra section, next to the patches section. In the composer.json file change: \"extra\": { ... to this. An example core patch is included, to show the correct syntax: \"extra\": {\n        \"composer-exit-on-patch-failure\": true,\n        \"patchLevel\": {\n            \"drupal/core\": \"-p2\",\n            \"drupal/contrib-module1\": \"-p1\",\n            \"drupal/contrib-module2\": \"-p1\"\n        },\n        \"patches\": {\n            \"drupal/core\": {\n                \"3212792: Views button hover effect is odd\": \"patches/3212792-2.patch\"\n            }\n        }, It's worth listing any contrib modules that you are patching, to explicitly use p1 , to help verify that patches are applied correctly. Since patches can change with new commits, it's recommended to download them, and use them as local files. Note: If you have tried clearing cache, running composer update etc. and a patch just won't apply, perhaps try removing the system folders with rm -rf web/core && rm -rf web/modules/contrib && rm -rf vendor and run composer install again. For more, see Composer-Patches: The Dependency You Never Knew You Needed . Patching without updating Drupal core or modules Sometimes you want to apply a patch to Drupal core or a contrib module, but not update anything else. Edit composer.json and add the patch Run composer install After composer install , sometimes the composer.lock file might not get updated with the latest patch information, so finally run this: composer update --lock This will generate a composer.lock file from composer.json with the new patch. Apply Drupal 8 Patch by Composer without update Drupal Core . Requiring a specific commit of a module In some cases you will need to apply a patch to a dev version of a module. In that case the patch may not apply properly if you aren't using a specific commit in the dev branch of the module. To require a specific commit, use the require format: composer require drupal/{modulename}:{version} For example: composer require drupal/eck:1.x-dev#ecf376 This is usually only necessary in the case that it has been a long time since the last stable release and you need to use the dev version of a module. When doing so, drupal.org's packaging process will include package version metadata that references the number of commits since the last tag. For example, requiring drupal/eck:1.x-dev#ecf376 will include the version 8.x-1.0-alpha5+13-dev metadata within composer.lock. This version metadata represents the +13 commit since the alpha5 tag. Where possible it is recommended to use the most recent stable release along with the patches you require. You should only use this as a temporary solution, until you can switch to tagged releases. The Composer team does not actively support commit references and will not accept bug reports related to it. For this reason, composer validate will complain with this warning: pointing to a commit-ref is bad practice and can cause unforeseen issues. Using Composer without drupal/recommended-project (advanced users) In some cases, you may want to create your own composer project without using the drupal/recommended-project template. This could depend on your web server configuration and familiarity with using Composer. Using drupal/recommended-project Without drupal/recommended-project Installs only in a \"web\" sub-directory Installs in your preferred installation path e.g. webroot, www, html, public_html, app, etc... Configures Composer usage without manually modifying JSON. Installs only what you want to install. You can create your own Composer project for your Drupal site without using the drupal/recommended-project template. Run composer init inside an empty directory to initialize a new composer project. Run composer require drupal/core-composer-scaffold composer/installers to install tools to help you structure and maintain your Drupal site. Run composer config repositories.drupal composer https://packages.drupal.org/8 to configure composer to download modules, themes and profiles from drupal.org. Modify the composer.json file to configure your preferred installation paths . It is highly recommended to use a sub-directory such as webroot, www, html, web, etc... when scaffolding your Drupal web site. Run composer require drupal/core-recommended to install Drupal core into your preferred directory structure. You could also require the drupal/core package, if you did not want to lock all of Drupal core's dependencies to known-good versions. Moving from drupal/core-recommended to drupal/core In some cases, you may have installed Drupal using drupal/core-recommended (e.g. via drupal/recommended-project ) and you want to instead depend on directly on drupal/core , for example when you need to update to a newer version of a dependency than is used in drupal/core-recommended . Note that your Composer dependencies will no longer be locked to specific minor versions after this change, so you will need to take care to avoid accidentally updating dependencies before your site is ready . Run composer remove --no-update drupal/core-recommended to remove dependency on drupal/core-recommended . Run composer require --update-with-all-dependencies drupal/core to install Drupal core using drupal/core and update to latest versions allowed by drupal/core . Note that on Drupal 9.4 and 9.5, the above commands will update your site from Guzzle 6 to 7 , which may cause fatal errors with some contributed or custom code. Review the instructions for managing Guzzle updates without drupal/core-recommended . Moving back to drupal/core-recommended from drupal/core Depending on drupal/core is only recommended as a temporary step so that sites can depend on Guzzle 7 or other dependency versions not allowed by drupal/core-recommended 's patch-level constraints. We recommend sites to move back to drupal/core-recommended when the update is addressed in core and when the site is upgraded to the latest Drupal release. Run composer remove --no-update drupal/core to remove the dependency on drupal/core . Run composer require --update-with-all-dependencies drupal/core-recommended to install Drupal core using drupal/core-recommended and use the latest versions allowed by drupal/core-recommended .

Concept: The User 1 Account Last updated on 28 August 2024 Prerequisite knowledge Section 7.1, “Concept: Users, Roles, and Permissions” What is the user 1 account? During the installation of your site, you created the first user account. Each\nuser account internally has a numeric user ID, and since the ID of this user is\none, it is commonly referred to as the user 1 account. This user account is\nspecial, because independent of what roles it is assigned, someone logged in as\nuser 1 has permission to do all actions on the site, including viewing and\nediting all content, editing any user account, changing site configuration,\ninstalling and uninstalling modules, and running the update script. Because of this level of permission, some people refer to this account as the root user , similar to the \"root\" user account that has full administrative\npermissions in Linux and other operating systems. It is usually better to make separate accounts for each administrative user,\ngiving them the Administrator role, rather than having all administrative\nusers log in using the user 1 account. There are several reasons for this: Some actions and updates on the site are logged, and if everyone uses the same\naccount, it is difficult to know who did them if you have questions. The Administrator role permissions can be modified to be safer than the\nfull permissions of the user 1 account, so that people do not inadvertently\nchange site features that shouldn’t be changed. People’s responsibilities on a site may change over time. With ordinary user\naccounts, this can be mirrored in permissions by assigning or unassigning\nroles to their user accounts. If they are all using the user 1 account,\nthis is more difficult. On some sites, the author of content or comments is displayed or tracked, and\nif everyone uses the same account to create content, it is difficult to know\nwho created the content. It is not possible to delete the user 1 account from the administrative user\ninterface. It would be possible to do with a database query, but it could cause\nproblems in your site and is not advisable.

Submit your session About Drupal Code of Conduct About Overview Drupal 11 Drupal 7 (legacy) Industries Our history Social media directory Values & Principles Drupal Core Accessibility Licensing FAQ - General Media Kit Drupal blog In the news Drupal Code of Conduct Support Sustainability This updated version of the Drupal community Code of Conduct took effect on July 1, 2023. Read the blog post for more details. Drupal is both a technical project and a professional and social community. Drupal's strength comes from the collaboration of its diverse and global contributors. The health of our community relies on the mutual respect of its members and a shared set of core values and norms. We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. We are committed to fostering a safer, more inclusive, and harassment-free environment for everyone, regardless of their race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, color, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, professional experience, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, tribal affiliation, caste, religion, appearance, or mental and physical ability. While every person is welcome, every behavior is not. This code of conduct describes how we expect community members to behave when interacting with each other. It also applies when we act as representatives of the project or community. In these cases, we have an additional responsibility for the impact of our words and actions. This code applies to digital and physical spaces where community members interact with each other publicly and privately. These include, but are not limited to: Drupal.org and other community websites Chat rooms and forums Social media Mailing lists Issue queues Physical and virtual events Video conferences and other virtual meeting places Any other places where community members gather to communicate or collaborate In addition, bullying or harassment of community members that occurs outside of community spaces will be considered a code of conduct violation. Access to community spaces may be restricted or removed as a result of a code of conduct violation. Repeated or extreme violations may result in indefinite removal from some or all community spaces. In these cases, community members must take responsibility for addressing the harm caused by their actions before access can be restored. Please use the Incident Report Form (or email drupal-cwg at drupal.org) to report a code of conduct violation. The reports are reviewed and acted upon by the Conflict Resolution Team . This team is a subset of the Drupal Community Working Group . Maintaining a welcoming community is a shared responsibility. Organizers, moderators, and administrators of community spaces are empowered to take action as necessary and appropriate to uphold the Code of Conduct. When action is taken within a community space, the responsible party is encouraged to report it to the Community Working Group. We consider the needs of others As an open source project, we are always building on the work of others. In turn, we are mindful of the needs of those who will be using our work, demonstrating patience, kindness and understanding. We think about the impact of our decisions on others and make choices that are as inclusive as possible. We recognize that community members communicate in different ways and use different languages. Everyone’s contributions are valued equally, whether they are paid contributors or volunteers. Examples of positive behaviors: Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people Using welcoming and inclusive language Being aware of cultural differences Focusing on what is best for our overall community, including who are most vulnerable Being kind to others Fostering safe and brave spaces where everyone is welcome to actively participate Examples of unacceptable behaviors: Psychological manipulation to deceive or create self-doubt in others (“gaslighting”) Demeaning others' opinions or efforts Being condescending, unwelcoming Discrimination against vulnerable or marginalized members of our community We treat each other with respect, even when we disagree It is expected that we will sometimes disagree with each other. However, disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We do not allow our frustrations to turn into personal attacks. When we observe such behavior, we refer those involved to our Code of Conduct. When we disagree, we first try to work things out between ourselves in a constructive manner. If that is not possible, we ask others to help us. This approach gives people more control over the outcome of their dispute. If that fails, we escalate the matter to designated leaders in our community. Our Conflict Resolution Policy provides clarity and direction for resolving conflicts. Examples of positive behaviors: Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences Being kind to others Respecting other people’s boundaries Centering mutual respect in your interactions with others Examples of unacceptable behaviors: Initiating controversy for the sake of controversy Trolling and other disingenuous behavior designed to provoke others Making insulting or derogatory comments We are collaborative When feasible, we work in the open and invite others to collaborate with us. We document our work and share our progress with others. We take responsibility for our words and actions and the impact they have on others. We listen to what others have to say and keep our minds open. Examples of positive behaviors: Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback Accepting responsibility for our mistakes and their consequences Learning from our experiences and making an effort to avoid similar mistakes in the future Accepting help from others Examples of unacceptable behaviors: Being disrespectful of other people's contributions Deliberately inflating your own contributions or taking credit for the contributions of others Blocking or restricting access to knowledge (“gatekeeping”) We do not tolerate abusive behavior Everyone is responsible for taking action against harassment, intimidation, bullying, and abuse. We speak up when we see others engaging in discriminatory, derogatory, or demeaning behavior. Those who experience or observe incidents of bullying, harassment, and abuse should report them using the Incident Report Form . All reports are reviewed by the Conflict Resolution Team, who will respond as necessary and appropriate. Care is taken to protect the privacy of reporters as well as those harmed or endangered by the incident. Those who are in immediate danger should seek the assistance of local law enforcement. Examples of positive behaviors: Reporting incidents of harassment or abuse Reminding others of the Code of Conduct Examples of unacceptable behaviors: Public or private harassment, threats, or intimidation Violent or abusive language directed against another person or group of people Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or exclusionary statements, regardless of intent Publishing people’s private information without their explicit permission. This includes full name, address (physical or email), and other personally sensitive information. The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following Unwelcome physical contact Intentionally misidentifying, misgendering and/or “deadnaming” an individual Disruptive behavior at talks and events Conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a public or professional setting. Such cases will be reviewed by the Conflict Resolution Team. We ask for help when we need it When we need clarity, we ask questions in simple, polite language to avoid problems later on. We understand that contributors may not have the time to answer every question. Before asking a question we review existing documentation to see if we can find the answer. If we find inaccurate or outdated documentation, we help to make sure it gets updated. We understand that those who are new to our community may not have the same knowledge or experience that we do. We document our work so that others may benefit from our experience and expertise. Examples of positive behaviors: Directing new users to the proper place to find the answers they need Asking clarifying questions in a considerate way Examples of unacceptable behaviors: Repeatedly asking maintainers for technical assistance without attempting to utilize other sources first. We step down considerately Members of every project come and go and Drupal is no different. Being able to take a break or step away is important for both our personal health and the health of our community. When it is time for us to leave, we do so in a way that minimizes disruption. We tell people we are leaving and take steps so that others are able to pick up where we left off. Our goal is to leave things better than we found them. Examples of positive behaviors: Taking breaks when needed Setting up others for success when we need to step away Succession planning for those in leadership roles Examples of unacceptable behaviors: Abandoning or quitting in a disruptive and/or destructive manner (“rage quitting”) We are here for each other Drupal values the unique talents, backgrounds, identities, and experiences of its members. Without them, we would not have a project or community. It is up to all of us to keep this community a friendly, welcoming, and inclusive place for everyone. We appreciate your support.

Please consider supporting Ukraine in a fight for their freedom and safety of Europe. Developer module that provides a place to upload external javascript plugins and libraries so the same library can be used by multiple modules. The common denominator for all Drupal modules/profiles/themes that integrate with external libraries. This module introduces a common repository for libraries in sites/all/libraries resp. sites/<domain>/libraries for contributed modules. External libraries Denotes libraries ( \"plugins\" ) that are neither shipped nor packaged with a project on drupal.org.  We do not want to host third-party libraries on drupal.org for a multitude of reasons, starting with licensing, proceeding to different release cycles, and not necessarily ending with fatal errors due to conflicts of having the same library installed in multiple versions. Drupal 7 only has built-in support for non-external libraries via hook_library().  But it  is only suitable for drupal.org projects that bundle their own library; i.e., the module author is the creator and vendor of the library.  Libraries API should be used for externally developed and distributed libraries.  A simple example would be a third-party jQuery plugin.

CKEditor 5 is available in Drupal 9.5+. CKEditor 4 LTS with security updates available until December 2026 If for any reason you can't upgrade to CKEditor 5 and you are interested in getting security updates for CKEditor 4 up until December 2026, please check the CKEditor 4 LTS module , where a special edition, CKEditor 4 LTS (\"Long Term Support\"), is available under commercial terms (\"Extended Support Model\") for anyone looking to extend the coverage of security updates and critical bug fixes. It provides the same functionality as this module and is backwards compatible. What is CKEditor? CKEditor is the far superior successor of FCKeditor. The editor has been rebranded and completely rewritten. It is now much faster (the code has been optimized), loads faster (the number of files has been reduced, so the browser will perform less HTTP requests) and developer-friendly.

You like the default taxonomy/term view, but you find you want to sort it differently; for example, alphabetically. You use /tracker, but you want to restrict it to posts of a certain type. You like the idea of the 'article' module, but it doesn't display articles the way you like. You want a way to display a block with the 5 most recent posts of some particular type. You want to provide 'unread forum posts'. You want a monthly archive similar to the typical Movable Type/Wordpress archives that displays a link to the in the form of \"Month, YYYY (X)\" where X is the number of posts that month, and displays them in a block. The links lead to a simple list of posts for that month. Views can do a lot more than that, but those are some of the obvious uses of Views. Views for Drupal 8 Views is in Drupal 8 core!

Content creators and site builders of all abilities should be able to use this platform to reach their audience. Disabilities are an integral part of our human experience. People have permanent, temporary, and situational disabilities. Prioritizing accessibility within Drupal is critical to our values. Digital tools are so embedded with our lives that accessibility is even more critical. Goals We are a community that believes in open standards. We  have committed to ensuring that all features of Drupal core align with the guidelines from the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)’s Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) . This initiative started in 2009 with adding accessibility advancements for Drupal 7. It was here we first embraced Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 AA for both front-end and back-end. With Drupal 8, we added support for Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) 2.0 (Part A was already included in Drupal 7). We began evaluating issues with WCAG 2.1 AA shortly after its release. Drupal is currently striving to attain WCAG 2.1 AA. Our community process and project governance will continue to align with the latest recommended release of the WCAG guidelines. Drupal was selected by the GAAD Foundation for the #GAADPledge in 2022 . This further cemented our public commitment to accessibility. As part of our GAAD Pledge we have created our Accessibility Coding Standards to help guide best practices in our community. The Drupal Accessibility Team follows the latest W3C WCAG Recommendations . Accessibility in Drupal’s Development Process The Drupal community tries to fix accessibility issues in the development process.  Everything is documented in the issue queue, and tagged for accessibility . Important issues can block a Drupal release if it fails the accessibility gate .  Our community has decided that accessibility is essential. Major releases have been delayed several times because identified barriers were not fixed. The team actively works to avoid adding accessibility regressions. When updates and modifications introduce accessibility regressions, fixing them becomes a priority. Occasionally barriers are discovered after release. If they are critical barriers, then the fixes may be part of an update to the latest stable release of Drupal. This is often avoided as changes to core code can have unintended consequences to live sites. Some of Drupal’s Accessibility features are described in the handbook . Automated Testing We use automated testing extensively. Some of the tools we use include WebAIM’s WAVE , Deque’s Axe and Microsoft’s Accessibility Insight s. There is also a list of recommended open source accessibility tools to check common accessibility issues. We acknowledge that automated tools and checklists have limitations. Manual testing and input from users with lived experience is required to build an inclusive experience. Assistive Technology Drupal encourages and supports the proper use of semantic markup. This is the best way to produce robust experiences that adapt to individual users’ assistive technologies (AT). Common examples of AT include: text-to-speech (TTS) tools like screen readers, speech-to-text (STT), hardware inputs such as keyboards and switch devices, screen magnification tools, many browser extensions. As of the most recent update to this document, testing with assistive technologies is primarily done with NVDA and VoiceOver. This is because they are common freely available screen readers. It is also easier to find volunteers who have the most knowledge of these tools. We build on the contributions from both blind developers and other experienced screen reader users as much as we can. We need more people with lived experience of disability to further improve Drupal's accessibility. HTML & ARIA Drupal semantics are defined with modern HTML5 and WAI Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA or ARIA) . We use ARIA landmarks to highlight the page regions. We try to limit the use of ARIA where possible. HTML generally provides more consistent support with assistive technologies. Core Module In Drupal Core, we want to build a platform that is accessible by default. This means that features specifically designed to support accessibility are typically enabled.This is because we  assume that most people will want to reach the widest possible audience when building a website. There are some exceptions to this: The Inline Form Error module is part of Core, but is not enabled by default. To have more accessible inline form errors, please consider enabling this module. You will need to enable internationalization support in CKEditor, if you want to be able to provide support for Language of Parts. Please suggest updates to this list. There may be other defaults that can be adjusted for specific accessibility goals. Contributed Modules Drupal Core usually has stricter criteria than the contributed modules and themes. It is worth noting that this isn’t always the case. We are happy to point to the Webform module as one which has gone above and beyond. Contributed modules may not always comply, but most developers follow community best practices. A list of contributed modules which may improve accessibility is available in the handbook. Core Themes Drupal Core themes have been developed with accessibility in mind. Most recently Olivero and Claro have been added to Drupal 9.  Extra effort has gone into the accessibility of the new default theme, Olivero. Olivero is named in honor of community member Rachel Olivero who died  suddenly in 2019. She was a blind developer who was active in promoting inclusion in the Drupal community. Contributed Themes Many of the accessibility challenges are implemented at the theme layers. It is generally an accessibility best practice in Drupal to start with an accessible base theme like Olivero and build out from there. There are non-Core themes constructed with accessibility in mind, but these are not organized. The list of tools, techniques, & resources in the handbook has also been updated with information that may be helpful. Unfortunately, there isn’t an up-to-date guide for creating accessible Drupal themes. The legacy guide for Accessible Theming for Drupal 7 is still useful. Drupal Community Sites The Drupal community is largely focused around three websites, Drupal.org , Drupal Groups and the API . These are managed by the Drupal Association . These sites are not always running the latest version of Drupal. Some accessibility issues in legacy code may not be prioritized if the barrier will be fixed with an upgrade. If you have issues that are stopping your participation, please contribute a bug to the issue queue for that project . Accessibility Team The accessibility team has worked to identify and resolve accessibility barriers with Drupal.  Any actively developed software will have some accessibility barriers. The challenge is to  proactively identify those issues and ensure that they are resolved quickly. We have an open issue queue and accessibility issues are tagged so that they are easy to find. This applies to both Drupal core and other projects on Drupal.org . Accessibility is a team effort, and although we have already done a lot, there is a lot more which we should be doing. In Drupal 7, the community decided to see accessibility barriers as bugs, rather than feature requests. This resulted in us raising awareness and changing the culture of the community. There are many ways to engage with our accessibility community. Most Drupal events include accessibility.  Drupal also uses Slack as a messaging platform . Please sign up and join the #accessibility channel. We are also hosting monthly A11y Office Hours to talk about accessibility issues in core. Please, consider joining #diversity-inclusion for a broader and  less technical discussion about inclusion in our community. More information is available about our accessibility community from our handbook . Our Community of Developers and Designers We need your involvement to make Drupal even more accessible. Here are some common ways people are involved: reporting bugs testing patches for bugs summarizing long comments threads adding or updating documentation answering questions on Slack If you have general questions on how to do this, please post a question to Slack. There are lots of ways to become involved.  We strive to make the development and design environment accessible to people with disabilities. The Drupal community is generally quite responsive to constructive user feedback. Do let us know what we can do to ensure you are included.

Get your tickets now Drupal.org Drupal.org Privacy Policy Drupal.org Terms of Service Drupal.org Privacy Policy Git Contributor Agreement Drupal.org Digital Advertising Policy Last updated: 25 Aug 2022 ​ We value your privacy and strive to protect your personal information. Please read this Policy to understand what types of information we collect from you, for what purposes and what choices you have regarding our collection of your information. This policy covers Drupal.org website and all *.drupal.org subsites (collectively, the \"Website\"). By accessing, using or posting information to this Website, you agree to this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Service . As stated in Section F of our Terms of Service , Drupal.org serves an international community, and so we are committed to complying with any applicable data protection laws and regulations, such as the EU's General Data Protection Regulation(GDPR) . Note that some regulations exempt non-profit organizations, including the California Consumer Privacy Act(CCPA) . Human Readable Summary Disclaimer: This summary is not itself a part of the Privacy Policy and is not a legal document. It is simply a handy reference for understanding privacy rights and regulations. Think of it as the user-friendly interface to the legal language of our Privacy Policy. In plain language, regulations such as GDPR define the following roles, rights, and responsibilities: Data Subject - this is you, the end user. Data Controller - this is us, the Drupal Association as the owners and operators of Drupal.org and its sub-sites. Data Processor - any other organization that processes personal data on behalf of the Data Controller. Rights of the Data Subject Right to be Informed - A data subject has the right to know whether personal information is being processed; where; and for what purpose. This information is outlined in the section below titled \"Information We Collect About You\" and \"How we Use Your Information\". Right to Access - A data subject has a right to access the information about them that is stored by the Data Controller. This information is outlined in the section below titled \"Information We Collect About You\" and \"How we Use Your Information\". Right to Rectification - A data subject has the right to correct any errors in the data about them. This can be done by editing your user account, or contacting the Drupal Association directly. Right to Restrict Processing - A data subject has the right to request that data not be processed, and yet also not be deleted by the Data Controller. Right to Object - A data subject has the right to opt out of marketing, processing based on legitimate interest, or processing for research or statistical purposes. Right to be Forgotten - Also known as the right to revoke consent, the right to be forgotten states that a data subject has the right to request erasure of data, the cessation of processing by the controller, and halting processing of the data by third party processors. The conditions for this, as outlined in article 17, include the data no longer being relevant to original purposes for processing, or a data subjects withdrawing consent. It should also be noted that this right requires controllers to compare the subjects' rights to \"the public interest in the availability of the data\" when considering such requests. This information is outlined in the sections below titled \"Accessing and Correcting Your Information\". Data Portability - A data subject has the right to receive a copy of their data in a 'commonly used and machine readable format.' This information is outlined in the sections below titled \"Your Choices About Use and Disclosure of Your Information\" and \"Accessing and Correcting Your Information\". Responsibilities of the Data Controller and Data Processors Privacy by Design - 'The controller shall..implement appropriate technical and organisational measures..in an effective way.. in order to meet the requirements of this Regulation and protect the rights of data subjects'. Article 23 of the GDPR calls for controllers to hold and process only the data absolutely necessary for the completion of its duties, as well as limit the access to personal data to those who need it to carry out these duties. Breach Notification - The Data Controller must notify the appropriate data processing authority and any affected end user of any breach that might result in 'risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals' within 72 hours of becoming aware of the breach. A Data Processor must notify the Data Controller of any breach 'without undue delay.' Data protection officer - A Data Controller or Processor must appoint a Data Protection Officer when: a Data Controller represents a public authority; or the core operations of the Controller require regular and systematic monitoring of Subjects on a large scale; or when the Controller's core operations depend on processing a large scale of special categories of data (including but not limited to health data, criminal conviction information, etc). The Drupal Association's core operations do not require the Association to establish a Data Protection Officer. Information We Collect About You We collect several types of information from and about you, including: 1. Your email address and password. We treat this information as \"Personally Identifiable Information\" or \"PII\". We never store passwords in plain text format, only secure password hashes. 2. Non-personally identifiable information, information about your computer system or device, your preferences, your online activity, and your location information (\"Non-Personally Identifiable Information\" a \"Non-PII\"). Non-PII, by itself, does not identify you, but it can be combined with other information in way that allows you to be identified. If this happens, we will treat the combined information as PII. We may collect information from or about you in the following ways: Information Provided by You . We collect information provided by you when you (1) create your public profile; (2) communicate with us or request information about or from us by e-mail or other means; (3) participate in our online forums or post content on this Website (\"User Contributions\"), (4) fill out forms or fields on this Website; (5) sign-up for any of our newsletters, materials or our services on this Website or other sites; or (6) participate in our online surveys or questionnaires. Automatic Information Collection .

Although you are encouraged to use the Drupal trademark (and the official Drupal logo (official link to be included when released by the Drupal Association), which is itself a use of the Drupal trademark) for your own purposes, you must first obtain a license. You can either obtain this license automatically , or through a license grant procedure , as further explained below in this policy. This policy therefore first explains whether you receive an automatic license, or whether you need to obtain a license through the license grant procedure. In addition, this policy explains which \"rules of use\" apply when you use the Drupal trademark (whether you obtained the license automatically, or through the license grant procedure). 2. Why this policy was created This policy is based on the questions received by Dries Buytaert from various persons and companies, and tries to cover the most typical use cases for the Drupal trademark. By imposing simple rules, this policy aims to create a level playing field for everyone interested in using the Drupal trademark. 3. Limitations of this policy Do not assume that this policy will answer every question you may have about the use of the Drupal trademark. There will be scenarios where your intended use of the Drupal trademark is not entirely covered by this policy, or where you have doubts as to whether or not a specific rule applies. In all these cases, you should contact Dries Buytaert . Please also note that, while the use of the official Drupal logo is covered by this trademark policy, the use of the Drupal icon (druplicon) is not. Any use of the Drupal icon is subject to separate licensing. Contact the Drupal Association for details. I. AUTOMATIC LICENSE OR LICENSE GRANT PROCEDURE? This section explains whether you are entitled to an automatic license (in which case you can use the Drupal trademark without having to complete or receive any document), or whether you need to follow the license grant procedure. You will only be entitled to an automatic license when you are in any of the situations described under subsection A below, and not simultaneously in any of the situations described under subsection B below. A. You receive an automatic license when: You exclusively use the Drupal trademark to either extend or improve the Drupal software, or to encourage the use of the Drupal software (in short \"foster the Drupal software\" ). Examples of \"fostering the Drupal software a course entitled \"How to use Drupal in your business\" organized by a local non-profit organization; an open access monthly journal called \"Drupal Coding magazine\"; an open source Apache plugin \"JIT Compiler for Drupal\"; a freely distributed homebrew Drupal theme \"John's Drupal Christmas Theme\"; a website \"drupalhalloffame.com\" with pictures of famous Drupal contributors; administering a database with Drupal bugs and corresponding workarounds. Examples which do not qualify as \"fostering the Drupal software\": creating a Drupal fork \"ImprovedDrupal\"; publishing a website \"drupalhallofshame.com\" with pictures of infamous Drupal contributors. Examples of not \"exclusively to foster the Drupal software\": a charitable organisation selling t-shirts with the Drupal trademark to sponsor its fight against global warming; a company selling t-shirts with the Drupal trademark, while donating 25% of the profits to the Drupal Association. \"Exclusively\" means that any direct profits generated by using the Drupal trademark, must also be exclusively used to foster the Drupal software. Examples: A high-traffic website \"drupalindepth.com\" containing sponsored ads, qualifies for an automatic license when the profits generated from these ads (minus hosting costs and other obvious costs incurred for maintaining the website) are used to pay a full-time developer working on the new open source Drupal template engine. A Drupal contributor wants to start a website called \"newtodrupal.com\", with helpful tutorials aimed at people new to Drupal. This website contains ads under the form of sponsored links, which would normally exclude the automatic license. However, because the referral code used for these ads is the Drupal Association's, any money earned goes directly to support the Drupal project. Hence, this website can benefit from an automatic license. The New York Drupal user group sells t-shirts with the Drupal trademark to sponsor its functioning. This also qualifies for an automatic license. The Drupal trademark is used in a domain name, title of website, title of a seminar, title of a course or title of a software package that is either exclusively intended to foster the Drupal software, or also mentions your trademark (or your trade name, name of your company, name of your organization, or name of your association). Example uses for which you receive an automatic license: a course entitled \"Acme's Drupal Gold Course\" or \"Acme's Drupal Certification Course\" or \"Acme's Learn to Code in Drupal \"; a domain name that is used for commercial purposes and is entitled \"drupalacme.com\" or \"commonusesofdrupal.acme.com\"; a domain name that is exclusively intended to foster Drupal use, and is entitled \"drupalusersgroupcalifornia.org\" or \"drupalunofficialfaq.com\"; an open source plugin to connect Acme's SQL-server to the Drupal software; a commercial plugin to connect Acme's SQL-server to the Drupal software, called \"Acme's SQL plugin for Drupal\"; a Drupal course entitled \"Drupal 6\" that is taught at a university; a free Drupal seminar entitled \"Creating websites with Drupal\", organized by a local non-profit organization Example uses for which the license grant procedure must be followed: a commercial website hosted under domain name \"commonusesofdrupal.com\"; a commercial course entitled \"Drupal Newbies Course 2009\". The Drupal trademark is used in the title of a book, newsletter, video, magazine or similar instructional instrument regarding Drupal that does not suggest an \"official link\". Example titles for which you receive an automatic license: \"Drupal ninja secrets: the complete guide\", \"Monthly Drupal Bits\", \"Drupal in Depth\", \"Drupal Step by Step\", \"John Smith's Drupal 6 Installation Guide\", \"Illustrated Drupal Guide\", \"More effective ways to use Drupal\", \"Drupal Screenshot Guided Tour\", \"Beginning Drupal\", \"Drupal inside out\", \"Drupal for network professionals\". Example titles for which the license grant procedure must be followed, because an \"official link\" may be suggested by the title (see B.1 below): \"Drupal 6\", \"Official Drupal Guide\", \"The Drupal Association's Book on Drupal\". The Drupal trademark is used for the title of a camp or meet-up. Examples: \"Drupal Bootcamp 2009\", \"Annual Drupal Meeting\", \"Drupal Gathering New York\", \"DrupalCamp Antarctica\". Note, however, that the license grant procedure must be used when the Drupal trademark is used in combination with the words \"conference\", \"convention\" or \"association\". See examples below. You want to display the official Drupal logo (whether for commercial or non-commercial use) in a standalone and unaltered form. \"Standalone\" means that the Drupal logo is not part of another logo. For example, a local Spanish Drupal user group that would like to create a \"Drupal Spain\" logo by extending the word \"Drupal\" with the word \"Spain\" (in the same font and color), will not be entitled to an automatic license. \"Unaltered\" means that the Drupal logo cannot be changed in any way — e.g., by changing the color, by slightly altering the shape of the letters, etc. Examples for which you receive an automatic license: creating a banner that displays the Drupal logo; using the Drupal logo on your (commercial or non-commercial) website; displaying the Drupal logo on product packaging; selling a t-shirt with the Drupal logo printed on the back. Your intended use qualifies as \"nominative fair use\" of the Drupal trademark, i.e., merely identifying that you are talking about Drupal in a text, without suggesting sponsorship or endorsement by Dries Buytaert or the Drupal Association. Examples: describing a new Drupal release in a review; referring to Drupal in a comprehensive overview of content management systems; complaining in a blog about a missing feature in the Drupal software; reporting about a Drupal conference on your personal homepage. The use of the Drupal trademark as part of the name of a function, procedure, variable name or similar source code component is also considered \"nominative fair use\" for which no license is required. Examples: a procedure called drupal_add_link(); a constant called DRUPAL_AUTHENTICATED_RID; a variable named $drupal_tag; a set of source code files called drupal.module and drupal.js. B. The license grant procedure must always be followed when you are in one or more of the following situations (even when you would also be in any of the situations under subsection A above) The use of the Drupal trademark suggests an \"official link\" between your product or service and Dries Buytaert / the Drupal Association (i.e., the product or service can be perceived as either emanating from Dries Buytaert / the Drupal Association, or being endorsed by Dries Buytaert / the Drupal Association). Examples: a domain name \"drupalofficialfaq.com\"; a domain name \"drupalsupport.nl\"; a company called \"Drupal Services Inc.\"; a course entitled \"Drupal Exams\". The Drupal trademark is used in combination with the words \"conference\", \"convention\" or \"association\", as well as any translation, abbreviation or variation thereof. Examples: \"drupalcon, \"drupalconference\", \"Drupalconvention\", \"drupal con\", \"drupal conference\", \"Drupal Convention\", \"Drupal Association\". The Drupal trademark is used as part of another registered trademark. Example: a trademark \"Drupal Plugin Optimizer\". The Drupal trademark is used as part of a \"drupal.tld\" domain name. Examples: \"drupal.com\", \"drupal.info\",\"drupal.co.uk\". The Drupal trademark is used as part of a domain name that covers either an entire category of products or services that are relevant to the Drupal community, that covers an entire target group of Drupal users or that is otherwise too generic. Examples for which the license grant procedure must be followed: \"drupal-design.com\", \"drupal-themes.co.uk\", \"drupal-modules.com\", \"drupal-support.nl\", \"drupal-hosting.com\", \"drupal-administrators.co.uk\", \"drupal-tshirts.com\", \"drupal-magazine.com\", \"mobiledrupal.com\", \"drupal-intranet.com\", \"drupal-services.com\", \"drupal-development.co.uk\". The Drupal trademark is used in a domain name, title of a website, title of a seminar, title of a course or title of a software package that is not exclusively intended to foster the Drupal software, and this domain name or title does not also mention your trademark (or your trade name, name of your company, name of your organization, or name of your association). Examples: when a \"Drupal Course for New Administrators\" is organized by a local Drupal community, the license grant procedure does not need to be used — even when a $600 registration fee would be requested — because the money earned is exclusively used to foster the Drupal software; when the same course is organized by a commercial organization and not all of the profits earned are used to foster the Drupal software, the license grant procedure must be followed; when the same course is organized by a commercial organization, but under the name of \"Acme's Drupal Course for New Administrators\", the license grant procedure does not need to be used, even when none of the profits earned are used to foster the Drupal software; when a commercial organization \"Acme\" has a product called \"Drupal River\" that is not exclusively intended to foster Drupal software, the license grant procedure must be followed; The Drupal trademark is used as part of the name of a company, organization, trade name or association. Examples: a company named \"Drupal, Inc.\", \"Drupal Experts GmbH\" or \"Drupal Support BV\"; \"Drupal Hosting LLC\"; an organization called \"Drupal Peru\" or \"Drupal User Group Germany\". You want to use the official Drupal logo in altered form or as part of another logo. There is any doubt as to how this policy should be interpreted or applied to a specific case. II. THE LICENSE GRANT PROCEDURE In the license grant procedure, you must complete a form with your contact details and a description of the intended use of the Drupal trademark. It may take a month or more for your application to be evaluated, and applications may be rejected for any reason (you may, however, reapply as often as you like). Furthermore, a license fee may be requested for any commercial use of the Drupal trademark. Although licenses are granted at Dries Buytaert's sole discretion, and specific conditions or obligations may be imposed, the following factors will be taken into account during the license grant procedure: With respect to a Drupal-related product or service , it will be considered whether the product or service: does not suggest an official link; promotes or expands Drupal adoption and usage; is not a fork of Drupal, and does not promote or encourage forks of Drupal; is licensed in a way that is compatible with the Drupal open source license; substantially strengthens and empowers the Drupal community; is of a high quality in both form and function; is created by significant contributors to the Drupal project; is created by those with a track record of liberally \"giving back\" to their communities; in the case of a domain name, does not create an unfair monopoly towards others because it spans a relevant category of services. With respect to the name of a company, organization or association , it is considered whether: the name does not suggest an official link; the company / organization or association is founded by significant contributors to the Drupal project, who have a track record of liberally \"giving back\" to their communities. III. RULES OF USE With the exception of the \"nominative fair use\" of the Drupal trademark, your use of the Drupal trademark is subject to the following rules (irrespective of whether you followed the license grant procedure or obtained an automatic license): Any use of the Drupal trademark implies acceptance of this policy. The Drupal trademark cannot be used for illegal, defamatory or humiliating purposes, or any other purpose that may negatively impact the Drupal software. Examples: a Drupal fork entitled \"A Better Drupal\"; a domain name \"drupal-is-worthless.com\" (note, however, that merely mentioning or referring to the Drupal software — for example in a critical blog post - qualifies as \"nominative fair use\", to which the rules of use do not apply). The name of your company or organization should be used in combination with the Drupal trademark so that there can be no confusion about the true source (company, organization, association or author) of your product or service. The combination of the name of your product or service with the Drupal trademark must be unique and identifiable. Examples: if your company is called \"Acme\", refer to your Drupal certification product as \"Acme Drupal Certification\" or \"Drupal Certification by Acme\" instead of \"Drupal Certification\"; or if your company called \"Acme\" has a Drupal podcast, clearly refer to it as the \"Acme Drupal Podcast\", \"Drupal Podcast provided by Acme\" instead of just \"Drupal Podcast\"; if your company called \"Acme\" has a product or service called \"Drupal River,\" clearly indicate that the \"Drupal River is a product (or service) of Acme\" so that there can be no confusion about the true source. The Drupal trademark should be accompanied by the following text (or an appropriate translation): \"Drupal is a registered trademark of Dries Buytaert.\" IV. OTHER LEGAL STUFF Any license granted under this policy, is legally granted as a sub-license by the company Dries Buytaert BVBA (company number 0893.231.032), which is mandated by Dries Buytaert to evaluate the applications and assign sub-licenses of the Drupal trademark on behalf of Dries Buytaert. Any license granted under this policy can be terminated upon sixty (60) days prior written notice if you breach any provision of this policy. If your breach can be cured (and you have not previously breached this policy), you may be granted forty-five (45) days from the date of notice to cure the breach. All implicit or automatic permissions or licenses to use the Drupal trademark that were granted before the publication of the current version of this policy are revoked after a grace period of six (6) months (calculated as from the date of publication). This policy — as well as the accompanying website - may be changed at any time. You accept that all licenses accorded under this policy are non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sub-licensable, revocable at any time, and subject to changes in policy. Hence, changes in this policy may cause permissions to be revoked or made dependent on additional obligations. Any changes to this policy will enter into force sixty (60) days after publication on the licensing page of the Drupal website ( https://www.drupal.org/about/trademark ). If any provision of this policy would be found by any court or administrative body of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, the invalidity or unenforceable of such provision shall not affect the other provisions of this policy, so that all other provisions shall remain in full force and effect. In such case, the invalid or unenforceable provision shall be replaced by a valid or enforceable provision that achieves to the greatest extent possible the economic, legal and commercial objectives of the invalid or unenforceable provision. All disputes in connection with this policy or any permission granted by it will be submitted to the applicable Court of Brussels, Belgium. This policy is governed by the laws and regulations of Belgium.
